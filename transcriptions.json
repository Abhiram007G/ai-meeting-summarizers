        "full_text": "During the COVID time also it was the cardiovascular death which was heading and we are all discussing about COVID unfortunately. We do not celebrate cardiovascular disease and all, okay. And that calls for a population level code blue. So this is a term which needs to be popularized. We all know code blue is in the hospital. This is a population level code blue which needs to be called. We have so much of advances in medicine right now, talking about medications for the heart disease, stenting for the heart disease, surgery for the heart disease. But despite that we all have a very high risk, there is something called as a residual risk. We are all used to seeing studies saying that this medication reduces the heart disease by 30 percent, 40 percent, the rest of which is called as residual risk. And look at this compilation. The ones in the red, I am sorry, the ones in the red are actually reduction by means of treatment what the hospital offers to you and the rest of it is actually the residual risk. But most of it is reduced by lifestyle modification. So what sort of a lifestyle modification is required that is basically on the dietary risk because that contributes to around 56 percent of the daily in India. So amongst the dietary risk what is important, we have all been told that not to eat so many things. They also contribute to heart disease. But what we have forgotten to eat is a major leading cause that is what contributes to and that is what the whole food plant based diet is all about. Okay now I am going to cover the entire talk on this 5P approach, places which have promoted whole food plant based diet. So we all, I remember Dr. Sam pointed out to the blue zones, but this is about the mummification that have of Egyptians which happened 5000 years ago and recently they were submitted for the calcium study. The calcium is basically to find out whether there is a fat deposition in the blood vessel or not. And majority, many of these people had calcium. This is despite the fact that there was no transport, so they are walking, there was no smoking, there was no blood pressure and majority of them were actually eating plant based diet though not a whole food plant based diet. Why did this happen? These are all consumed by the common people, but the people who are mummified were actually the king, queens and the people who connected them to God at least in their own words called the priests. So these are the people who are actually eating lot of saturated fatty acid and this is what led to their coronary artery disease. Coming to the, that is about places, coming to the pioneers and projects, both of them actually mentioned about Dean Ornish and Esselstyn, but what, the pioneer is actually Lister Morrison that was in 1940s when there was no medical aid at all for the heart disease. The only thing which was made was to make people lie down forever, for few weeks to months when they had a heart attack, in fact some of them committed suicide in the process because they could not lie down without turning, ok. So that was the time when Lister Morrison did a study. So he took 100 patients with the heart disease, 50 cases and 50 controls and those 50 controls were given moderately low fat vegetarian diet, that is all. It is not the whole food plant based diet which we are talking about now and these people are followed for 12 years. None of the people in the control group survived, whereas 38 percent survived in the case control, case group. Coming to Dean Ornish, already they pointed out about the lifestyle heart disease trial, lifestyle heart trial. So there was a reduction in the size of the blockages in these people significantly, but I am not bothered about this. In this August audience, I would like to show that this Ornish program has been approved by Medicare. So Medicare is what dictates us and sometimes scientifically too. For all of you know, who know about the blood pressure, initially a blood pressure of 200 bar, 120, 140 were also not to be treated and it was the insurance people who pointed out that it has to be treated. So that is the value of these people. Coming to Esselstyn, Esselstyn has done lots of studies. In one of these studies, he has, he took up 198 patients and put them on a whole food plant based diet and they followed up for 4 years and the people who are adherent to the whole food plant based diet, there was no maze and out of the 21 people who are not adherent, 13 had a major adverse event in the follow up. So this picture was shown by him. This is something which is showing the, ok this pointer is not working, this is showing that there is a reverse law. So this is where the blockage is, following the diet, they showed a nearly healthy artery in these patients. Ok. The one study which has to be quoted in this context is about the non-substantive heart trial which was done in Rajasthan. So that they have included the whole food plant based diet as well as the Rajayoga in these patients and they also showed a similar improvement in the lesions and of course Dr. Trajna touched upon all these things. Then came the concept of plant based dietary index, healthy and unhealthy plant based dietary index are shown in the red, that means there is a decline, there is an increase in the mortality with every 10 unit increment and the one in green shows that there is a betterment in the mortality when we have a 10 unit increment in the healthy plant based dietary index. Pathways, how do the, how does this plant based diet work? The six pillars were elaborated by Dr. Sam, but here I am focusing on eating alone. Eating actually makes you, eating a healthy plant based diet makes you exercise better and the healing following the injuries makes also heal better and of course we had a discussion on the sleep and stress and it is said that people who are into the habit of smoking and alcohol and they resort to healthy plant based diet, they can give up better and the relationship part the, I would here connect to more to the environmental aspect. Well, everybody knows that I do not need to elaborate on how the conventional risk factors are taken care of by the whole food plant based diet. I would like to focus on certain unique risk factors. This morning we were hearing about the oxidized LDL and this Taiwanese study said that LDL in vegetarians is less oxidizable. You heard this morning isn't it, LDL is not that as pathogenic as oxidized LDL and the second point which I would like to focus is on the LDL forms that is the small density LDL and this is a small data from our source. We had 442 patients analyzed and out of I mean 442 patients with MI out of which 148 had normal cholesterol at the time of presentation and out of the 148, 25 had a very high small density LDL. Why am I mentioning this? The SDLDL is not actually acted upon by the statins and whereas the whole food plant based diet brings it down. The other unique risk factor is the lipoprotein A which is not talked about much though lipoprotein A is more dangerous than LDL. So lipoprotein A is not brought down by statins, paradoxically it is actually increased. We all praise statins, I am not against statins, I am not for statins either, but the lipoprotein A is actually increased by the statins. This is a stat from our electronic medical record of a patient who had a bypass surgery, but continued to have symptoms within 1 month of the surgery and this when she came to us her LPA was 220 which is brought down by 50 percent by just the whole food plant based diet. Well, the when we talk about dietary restriction, dietary changes for the heart disease everybody talks about the calorie restriction and we all know unfortunately sometimes it is mistaken for a portion control also. So coming to this calorie aspect, this is again from Esselstyn that is folks over knives, you can also go through this. So for 500 calories prescribed you can take a whole stomach full of whole food plant based diet whereas if you are going for a refined diet or the ones which promote the production of trimethylaminoxide. So that can result in heart disease, the stroke that can result in heart failure as well as some rhythm abnormalities in the heart. I would like to point out the importance of this trimethylaminoxide by a small study which was done in our hospital where 44 patients with heart disease they were evaluated for their all the risk factors along with the TMAO. So TMAO was elevated in all the 40 I mean 43 out of 44 patients whereas 16 patients did not have any conventional risk factors, 16 percent of the patients did not have any of the risk factors which is commonly talked about in the hospital. hypertension, diabetes, all those things and we followed up these patients for 2 years. There was a tendency to have higher major adverse cardiovascular events for people who had a higher trimethylamine oxide. The one thing which is conveniently forgotten in our day to day life is endothelial dysfunction. You heard about a bit this morning. So the endothelium is the one which gets disrupted, we were talking about the early onset of obesity, the early onset of diabetes, all that NCDs and angsts, it is all because of the endothelial dysfunction and as the disease progress in every stage of atherosclerosis it is the endothelium which plays a major role and we actually do not talk about endothelium to our patients at all. And look at the sources of nitric oxide, endothelium, the job of endothelium is basically to produce nitric oxide and with the aging the endothelium does not produce, it has to be substituted by your diet and looking at the diet it is the basically the vegetables which give the very high nitrate source whereas the animal source do not have this at all. Look at this classification based on the nitrate content and some of these things I have not heard, I have not seen. So where is the study from Indians before anybody asks me, I would like to say that it is important that we start because there are at least 52 types, 50 plus types of greens and herbs available in our population and we do not have major studies with that ok. So we all know when a patient has a heart attack we put in a stent and we believe that everything is cured, but there is something called as a re-stenosis because the endothelium grows inside the stent which was been put inside. So this was a study nitrate OCT study where people were randomized and given one arm was given 70 ml of beetroot juice, the other arm was given nitrate depleted similar looking beet beetroot ok. So look at this, this is a major cardiovascular event difference, the one which very less events in the nitrate group and the placebo group had a very high mortality. This is at the end of 2 years, I would like to stress the importance of this endothelium in one of the studies which we had done. We had this is just before COVID we had taken 28 patients who had undergone multiple procedures where on maximal medications, but continue to have angina. So we admitted them for 28 patients, we admitted them for 10 days and one important thing is all of them were statins and their male cholesterol was less than 8 around 80s and around 82 percent of them actually had a normal inflammatory state as measured by CRP. 15 of them despite having a near reasonable good cholesterol and normal CRP had endothelial dysfunction and with pan based diet 8 of them improved in 10 days, rest of them had a normal endothelial function. There are lot of missing links in here, but endothelial function is not 100 percent set right by your any of the procedures that is what I would like to emphasize on. This is a primary prevention data from our comprehensive health checkup, we all know that CT coronary calcium is the one which is advised to find out subclinical atherosclerosis. So we had one arm how many of the patients had CT coronary calcium, in the other arm all the variables which we have that is your sugar, cholesterol, everything else everything and the best correlation with the CT coronary calcium actually came up from endothelial dysfunction. So after the people who out of the 132 people who had CT coronary calcium 116 actually had endothelial dysfunction. Well in one another interesting way whereby the diet contributes to health cardiovascular health is that the plant based diet promotes I mean has intrinsically lot of salicylates. If you look at this source the people who consume lots of herbs and spices have a higher salicylic content and the vegetarians have an advantage of starting off with the 75 milligram of aspirin from the whole food plant based diet. Well this part I think you heard in the main hall about the mitochondrial protectors. So the mitochondrial defective mitophagy actually ensures that there is a lot of ROS produced which induces the chronic inflammatory state and endothelial dysfunction which can be offset by Mediterranean diet and we had a talk I mean we had some discussion on the telomeres from both Sam and Regina and the telomere length can be elongated by various plant based diet. So inflammate this is another study showing that the inflammated markers are high in vegetarians and low in I am sorry high in omnivores and low in vegetarians and this is another thing to say that the heme iron is a heme iron is predominantly in animal sourced food. So if you are going to take lot of heme iron that is very common in the Indians actually. So it is a general myth that people who are anemic should consume lot of non-veg and it is a heme iron which actually promotes CVD. The common well I will possibly skip this now the CVD and longevity all whatever I have spoken are basically ones which will act either to the inflammatory pathway or to the endothelial dysfunction or the lipid peroxidation and platelet dysfunction the all these things act in one of these pathways and it could be offset by whole food plant based diet. The various mechanisms again I will slip this slide I am coming to the last bit of my presentation that is on preventive guidelines we all depend on the guidelines set by the westerners are the westerners actually talking about whole food plant based diet like what Dr. Sam said the cardiologist may not be aware of this unfortunately but both the European Institute of Cardiology and the American Heart Association actually prescribed whole food plant based diet. Look at this they have said whole and minimally processed fruits and vegetables and proteins from plants actually this is what they prescribed but we fail to go through this and various guidelines from variety of countries have shown whole food plant based diet as hope it is complete it is for all walks of age it is something which is reducing the MCD it protects immunity and see the Belgium says that we can have calcium without dairy just one few seconds sorry for that. So the PERLS the last P is basically the whole food plant based diet promotes reversal of atherosclerosis without major side effects and it augments the effects of medications and interventions which the cardiologist prescribed and is hence useful for the longevity. So the research questions from my side I am not going to any of those complex things which we have discussed in the main hall because I am not into it but for a common clinician like me I would like to know which of the herbs and greens of India promote endothelial function and in which order and in which form. Gut microbes the majority of the studies are from the westerners and we have we just did it on 48 patients because of the lack of fund and what are going to be the non costly non invasive staining modalities in for CVD in India because the one which we follow for the endothelial dysfunction is pretty costly and finally I just like to end up with this what is the other meaning of Akiya, Akiya means desire not just for personal success but for leaving a mark on the world at the end of this conference we should leave a mark on the world. If not on longevity but on longevity.",

        "full_text": "about the longevity part of it and the health part of it, one of the primary components of longevity and health is exercise, and exercise as a prescription has often been neglected possibly because of, yeah, possibly because of slightly lower potential for research. I just would like to, my co-presenter, Dr. Jaspal Singh Sandhu, he is the Vice-Chancellor of Lovely Professional University, physically, the slide was prepared a few days earlier and right now he is also the advisor to the Governor of Punjab in this aspect. So coming to these, the aspect about the exercise as medicine, the prescriptive as well as the preventive role of exercise. We have to start right at the beginning about what is physical activity, WHO defines physical activities as any bodily movement which has got energy expenditure. It is often used interchangeably with exercise which is a much more structured and planned and repetitive motion which has got some objective in it. So our daily time physical activity, the transportation, the personal work, the way I walked up to this place is physical activity, may not be exercise, but it does have a role in trying to prevent as well as in prescribing exercise as a medicine. Another aspect that we keep, tend to overlook is the sedentary behavior. Not only does exercise promote health, in the reverse way, sedentary behavior also tends to decrease your health and tends to decrease your longevity and it is not just about longevity and we will come to that in a little while. Chronic diseases, when we talk about chronic diseases, WHO basically tends to put non-communicable diseases and NCDs and chronic diseases together. In fact, it is all that is short of the communicable diseases, the maternal mortality, the perinatal mortality and the nutritional diseases are generally termed together as a part of the chronic diseases. This becomes very, very important for us because even though the chronic diseases, the NCDs are being attributed more in the west, we are bearing the greater burden of the three quarters of the global NCDs is being, deaths are being attributed in the middle and the low income companies and economic burden is huge. When we talk about longevity, we always talk about how many years the person is living. There is another term called the healthy life expectancy, which we have often been trying to overlook and I am very happy that in the present conference, even in the main hall, this has been frequently addressed to much more than the life expectancy per se. In fact, when we talk about the life expectancy per se and the healthy life expectancy, the gap between the overall life and the healthy life is increasing so more and more people are spending more and more time being sick towards the later part of our life. A friend of mine who really loves to eat, who likes to party and does not believe in exercise at all, once told me, what's the point in being healthy? It's ultimately going to add years to your old age. Yes, unfortunately, this is correct. The other unfortunate part is what I have pointed out here is that the sex gap, the gender gap between healthy and unhealthy towards the later part keeps increasing and with the exception of these 1, 2, 3 and 4 conditions, this is being the intentional injuries, the others, these are the only conditions in which the male is living for slightly shorter duration. The burden of health, the burden of longevity as an unhealthy people is being borne more by the female even in the highest of the population. This particular data is from the US whereas this data is from all the WHO countries. How does that actually affect us? Now this is the data from the USA and compared with the data from India. We are seeing that 88% of NCDs in the US is attributable to NCDs whereas in India it is only around 66%. That primarily means that we have not been able to take care of the communicable diseases, of the perinatal mortality, of the nutritional conditions and we are yet to catch up in this aspect and coming to the other part of it, if we look at the one-fourth of this condition which is due to the cardiac conditions, the one-fourth of the Indian population is possibly more than the entire US population. The disease burden is really, really heavy and this is translated to, you can see our per year is 51 billion whereas in India it is barely around 3 billion and it is expected that this study was based on the data from 2019. It was expected that by 2030 our decade budget is going to be around 50 billion. This is a huge number. What is the even more worrying trend is given here. The physical inactivity in US in the adolescence is lower than that of India. As we have started becoming more and more economically developed, we have started going into the habit of physical inactivity and while I have not mentioned it in my course of presentation, there have been ample amount of studies that physical activity, higher level of physical activity as a young child, as an adolescent tends to add to the protective influence for even up to two decades. When a person becomes physically active later on in life, they tend to catch up very frequently but their protection does not continue for as long as a person who has been active as a child and as an adolescent. And this is a very, very worrying trend for a country like India. Lifestyle diseases as an epidemic has proven to be very hard and we in India are wearing the brunt of it. As a representation of the heart diseases, it is already at the very, very highest. So let's turn from there to the power of exercise and about the benefits, the prescriptive and the preventive benefits of exercise for that. Much of what I am going to be presenting is going to be from multiple meta-analysis but the Harvard Alumni Health Study and the Aerobic Centered Longitudinal Study, ACLS, were pioneers in their field. The Harvard Alumni Health Study was a very simple one. They started collecting data of their alumni from 1938 to around 1950s, I am quoting the exact year, and they had multiple data collection points. When they started, they had around 25,000 alumni and by the time they ended the study in 1993, they were left with around 11,000 alumni and that gave us a huge amount of data. The ACLS was based on a clinic in Dallas, Texas, where the employees of that clinic and the relatives and the people who decided to walk in were just followed throughout. It was an epidemiological study and the end value, the number of people studied was almost 50,000. The study was more than 50,000. The study was continued for 15 years. 25%, 24%, 24 point something percent of that group was people who was engaged in a lot of running activities. Now, these two studies have given us a huge amount of data and we are still drawing from that. What does that tell us? Now, the total energy expenditure and energy expenditure from vigorous activities. Vigorous activities in that particular study was defined as more than 3,150 kilojoules, not kilocalories, kilojoules. Both these were inversely related to mortality from all causes and the protective influence was 22% to 31% in men and women when you had a vigorous activity and when you had lots of activity but falling short of vigorous, even then the difference was quite a lot. There was a dose response curve which showed a little bit of saturation to the response as you went for higher and higher amount of vigorous studies. So, basically it was trying to tell us that even moderate activities were very, very helpful. The effect of vigorous activity caused a reduction on 9% from all causes mortality and even when we came to about the moderate physical activity, it was around 4% decrease. When we increased the dose from around 1 hour per week to around 2.5 hour per week to around 7 hours per week, we saw an incremental increase in the response time, in the response about protection from mortality. Walking has been considered as a very interesting leisure time activity and has been studied very frequently mainly because it is so simple to do. You do not require any gadgets, you need your two legs, you can just start walking. And this has shown that with increasing duration of walking, you are coming to a lot of protective influence. With a lower duration of walking, the relative risk of death from all causes was much, much higher. Another interesting part is that even when a person is walking quite a lot but the sedentary behavior as and when it keeps increasing, the sedentary behavior independently increased the risk of mortality from all causes. So, it is not only important that you exercise once or twice a day. It is a much better idea if you are able to incorporate exercise and physical activity as a part of your daily routine. So, instead of walking and instead of going by car, try and walk a bit. Try and park the car away a little bit. Coming to a cardiovascular risk. Now, 2000 kilocalories, the reason I have stuck with 2000 kilocalories is that This is what aligns with most of the recommendations of physical activity. 39% lower risk of developing cardiovascular disease and deaths from cardiovascular diseases. Now, when we talk about how much it actually translates to, we have missed this bus. We were not really very wise in choosing our parents. But short of that, two things which have got a better risk protection than choosing our parents wisely would be exercise and total abstinence from cigarette. Other things which contribute, abolishing hypertension and management of obesity. So do not underestimate the power of simple movement and simple physical activity. This is from the ACLS. This tries to tell us that whatever physical activity you choose and whatever parameter choose, the physical activity in this case chosen has been running. But whatever parameter you choose and by extrapolation, whatever physical activity you choose, the protective influence is going to be almost equally good. So whether you are thinking in terms of the time or the distance covered or the speed that by which you are trying to run, everything turns out to be giving you a good amount of protective influence. So it is a very good idea to choose an activity you like. You choose the duration you like, choose the intensity you like, and we can go for the physical activity. And we can reap the benefits of lowered risk in either way. Now, diabetes mellitus deserves slightly special mention because the influence of exercise on diabetes is slightly different. Whereas in others, a dose-dependent reduction was seen, which was saturated. In diabetes, while it is a non-linear relation, the saturation effect does not completely even at a very, very high dose. At the same time, in diabetes, it has been observed that even small durations of activity which have been carried throughout the day are going to be very, very, very helpful. And diabetes is another aspect where sedentary behavior is known to be causing much greater damage than non-sedentary behavior. This is from a meta-analysis where I have tried to see the reduction in the different types of cancer. So the bladder cancer, the breast cancer, colon, endometrium, esophagus, kidney, stomach, and possibly liver cancer have got a lot of reduced risk due to regular physical activity, which happens mainly as a reduced reduction in anxiety, depression, and fatigue, and improved bone and sleep quality of life. We'll just be at a rest because we are trying to save a bit of the time. The cognitive functions, there has been a decent amount of proof that there is a lot of decreased risk of the development of depression. At the same time, it also helps in improving your cognition. To summarize that, we are finding that there's ample amount of evidence for lots and lots of conditions which tend to impact your lifestyle and tends to increase your overall longevity and tends to increase your quality of life. Over the next few slides, I'll actually try to summarize what I have presented. But this one particular slide from ACSM tries to give a lot of evidence of the prescriptive nature of exercise. And based on these aerobic activity, resistance activity, mind-body activity, and the balance training activity, they tend to work on all of these parameters. And this becomes a very good guideline in the future as far as the prescription of exercise is concerned. I will just skip through some of the rest of the slides. And we will come straight to the main point of longevity for everyone. Longevity does not merely mean adding years to your life. The most important point is adding life to years to decrease the burden of disease in the later part of your life. And this is where even a little bit of exercise can help you live longer and can help you live better. The guidelines, exercise whenever you can, 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of resistance activity per week is a very good beginning point. I'm not saying this is enough, but it's a very good beginning point. How to do that? Break it up into small things. Take the stairs. Walk during the breaks. Cycle to work. Small, small habits which can literally change your life. Exercise is medicine. I would like to leave with this particular slide, which I have taken from a couple of presentations from WHO. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.",

                "text": "about the longevity part of it and the health part of it, one of the primary components of longevity and health is exercise, and exercise as a prescription has often been neglected possibly because of, yeah, possibly because of slightly lower potential for research. I just would like to, my co-presenter, Dr. Jaspal Singh Sandhu, he is the Vice-Chancellor of Lovely Professional University, physically, the slide was prepared a few days earlier and right now he is also the advisor to the Governor of Punjab in this aspect. So coming to these, the aspect about the exercise as medicine, the prescriptive as well as the preventive role of exercise. We have to start right at the beginning about what is physical activity, WHO defines physical activities as any bodily movement which has got energy expenditure. It is often used interchangeably with exercise which is a much more structured and planned and repetitive motion which has got some objective in it. So our daily time physical activity, the transportation, the personal work, the way I walked up to this place is physical activity, may not be exercise, but it does have a role in trying to prevent as well as in prescribing exercise as a medicine. Another aspect that we keep, tend to overlook is the sedentary behavior. Not only does exercise promote health, in the reverse way, sedentary behavior also tends to decrease your health and tends to decrease your longevity and it is not just about longevity and we will come to that in a little while. Chronic diseases, when we talk about chronic diseases, WHO basically tends to put non-communicable diseases and NCDs and chronic diseases together. In fact, it is all that is short of the communicable diseases, the maternal mortality, the perinatal mortality and the nutritional diseases are generally termed together as a part of the chronic diseases. This becomes very, very important for us because even though the chronic diseases, the NCDs are being attributed more in the west, we are bearing the greater burden of the three quarters of the global NCDs is being, deaths are being attributed in the middle and the low income companies and economic burden is huge. When we talk about longevity, we always talk about how many years the person is living. There is another term called the healthy life expectancy, which we have often been trying to overlook and I am very happy that in the present conference, even in the main hall, this has been frequently addressed to much more than the life expectancy per se. In fact, when we talk about the life expectancy per se and the healthy life expectancy, the gap between the overall life and the healthy life is increasing so more and more people are spending more and more time being sick towards the later part of our life. A friend of mine who really loves to eat, who likes to party and does not believe in exercise at all, once told me, what's the point in being healthy? It's ultimately going to add years to your old age. Yes, unfortunately, this is correct. The other unfortunate part is what I have pointed out here is that the sex gap, the gender gap between healthy and unhealthy towards the later part keeps increasing and with the exception of these 1, 2, 3 and 4 conditions, this is being the intentional injuries, the others, these are the only conditions in which the male is living for slightly shorter duration. The burden of health, the burden of longevity as an unhealthy people is being borne more by the female even in the highest of the population. This particular data is from the US whereas this data is from all the WHO countries. How does that actually affect us? Now this is the data from the USA and compared with the data from India. We are seeing that 88% of NCDs in the US is attributable to NCDs whereas in India it is only around 66%. That primarily means that we have not been able to take care of the communicable diseases, of the perinatal mortality, of the nutritional conditions and we are yet to catch up in this aspect and coming to the other part of it, if we look at the one-fourth of this condition which is due to the cardiac conditions, the one-fourth of the Indian population is possibly more than the entire US population.

Now these two studies have given us a huge mine of data and we are still drawing from that. What does that tell us? Now the total energy expenditure and energy expenditure from vigorous activities. Vigorous activities in that particular study was defined as more than 3,150 kilojoules, not kilocalories, kilojoules. Both these were inversely related to mortality from all causes and the protective influence was 22 percent to 31 percent in men and women when you had a vigorous activity and when you had lots of activity but falling short of vigorous, even then the difference was quite a lot.

The guidelines, exercise whenever you can, 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of resistance activity per week is a very good beginning point. I'm not saying this is enough, but it's a very good beginning point. How to do that? Break it up into small things. Take the stairs. Walk during the breaks. Cycle to work. Small, small habits which can literally change your life. Exercise is medicine. I would like to leave with this particular slide, which I have taken from a couple of presentations from WHO. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.",

                "text": "about the longevity part of it and the health part of it, one of the primary components of longevity and health is exercise, and exercise as a prescription has often been neglected possibly because of, yeah, possibly because of slightly lower potential for research. I just would like to, my co-presenter, Dr. Jaspal Singh Sandhu, he is the Vice-Chancellor of Lovely Professional University, physically, the slide was prepared a few days earlier and right now he is also the advisor to the Governor of Punjab in this aspect. So coming to these, the aspect about the exercise as medicine, the prescriptive as well as the preventive role of exercise. We have to start right at the beginning about what is physical activity, WHO defines physical activities as any bodily movement which has got energy expenditure. It is often used interchangeably with exercise which is a much more structured and planned and repetitive motion which has got some objective in it. So our daily time physical activity, the transportation, the personal work, the way I walked up to this place is physical activity, may not be exercise, but it does have a role in trying to prevent as well as in prescribing exercise as a medicine. Another aspect that we keep, tend to overlook is the sedentary behavior. Not only does exercise promote health, in the reverse way, sedentary behavior also tends to decrease your health and tends to decrease your longevity and it is not just about longevity and we will come to that in a little while. Chronic diseases, when we talk about chronic diseases, WHO basically tends to put non-communicable diseases and NCDs and chronic diseases together. In fact, it is all that is short of the communicable diseases, the maternal mortality, the perinatal mortality and the nutritional diseases are generally termed together as a part of the chronic diseases. This becomes very, very important for us because even though the chronic diseases, the NCDs are being attributed more in the west, we are bearing the greater burden of the three quarters of the global NCDs is being, deaths are being attributed in the middle and the low income companies and economic burden is huge. When we talk about longevity, we always talk about how many years the person is living. There is another term called the healthy life expectancy, which we have often been trying to overlook and I am very happy that in the present conference, even in the meal hall, this has been frequently addressed to much more than the life expectancy per se. In fact, when we talk about the life expectancy per se and the healthy life expectancy, the gap between the overall life and the healthy life is increasing so more and more people are spending more and more time being sick towards the later part of our life. A friend of mine who really loves to eat, who likes to party and does not believe in exercise at all, once told me, what's the point in being healthy? It's ultimately going to add years to your old age. Yes, unfortunately, this is correct. The other unfortunate part is what I have pointed out here is that the sex gap, the gender gap between healthy and unhealthy towards the later part keeps increasing and with the exception of these 1, 2, 3 and 4 conditions, this is being the intentional injuries, the others, these are the only conditions in which the male is living for slightly shorter duration. The burden of health, the burden of longevity as an unhealthy people is being borne more by the female even in the highest of the population. This particular data is from the US whereas this data is from all the WHO countries. How does that actually affect us? Now this is the data from the USA and compared with the data from India. We are seeing that 88% of NCDs in the US is attributable to NCDs whereas in India it is only around 66%. That primarily means that we have not been able to take care of the communicable diseases, of the perinatal mortality, of the nutritional conditions and we are yet to catch up in this aspect and coming to the other part of it, if we look at the one-fourth of this condition which is due to the cardiac conditions, the one-fourth of the Indian population is possibly more than the entire US population. The disease burden is really, really heavy and this is translated to, you can see our per year is 51 billion whereas in India it is barely around 3 billion and it is expected that this study was based on the data from 2019. It was expected that by 2030 our decade budget is going to be around 50 billion. This is a huge number. What is the even more worrying trend is given here. The physical inactivity in US in the adolescence is lower than that of India. As we have started becoming more and more economically developed, we have started going into the habit of physical inactivity and while I have not mentioned it in my course of presentation, there have been ample amount of studies that physical activity, higher level of physical activity as a young child, as an adolescent tends to add to the protective influence for even up to two decades. When a person becomes physically active later on in life, they tend to catch up very frequently but their protection does not continue for as long as a person who has been active as a child and as an adolescent. And this is a very, very worrying trend for a country like India. Lifestyle diseases as an epidemic has proven to be very hard and we in India are wearing the brunt of it. As a representation of the heart diseases, it is already at the very, very highest. So let's turn from there to the power of exercise and about the benefits, the prescriptive and the preventive benefits of exercise for that. Much of what I am going to be presenting is going to be from multiple meta-analysis but the Harvard Alumni Health Study and the Aerobic Centered Longitudinal Study, ACLS, where pioneers in their field. The Harvard Alumni Health Study was a very simple one. They started collecting data of their alumni from 1938 to around 1950s, I am talking the exact year, and they had multiple data collection points. When they started, they had around 25,000 alumni and by the time they ended the study in 1993, they were left with around 11,000 alumni and that gave us a huge amount of data. The ACLS was based on a clinic in Dallas, Texas, where the employees of that clinic and the relatives and the people who decided to walk in were just followed throughout. It was an epidemiological study and the end value, the number of people studied was almost 50,000. The study was more than 50,000. The study was continued for 15 years. 25 percent, 24 percent, 24 point something percent of that group were people who were engaged in a lot of running activities. Now these two studies have given us a huge mine of data and we are still drawing from that. What does that tell us? Now the total energy expenditure and energy expenditure from vigorous activities. Vigorous activities in that particular study was defined as more than 3,150 kilojoules, not kilocalories, kilojoules. Both these were inversely related to mortality from all causes and the protective influence was 22 percent to 31 percent in men and women when you had a vigorous activity and when you had lots of activity but falling short of vigorous, even then the difference was quite a lot. There was a dose response curve which showed a little bit of saturation to the response as you went for higher and higher amount of vigorous studies. So basically it was trying to tell us that even moderate activities were very, very helpful. The effect of vigorous activity caused a reduction on 9 percent from all causes mortality and even when we came to about the moderate physical activity, it was around 4 percent decrease. When we increased the dose from around 1 hour per week to around 2.5 hour per week to around 7 hours per week, we saw an incremental increase in the response time, in the response about protection from mortality. Walking has been considered as a very interesting leisure time activity and has been studied very frequently mainly because it is so simple to do. You do not require any gadgets, you need your two legs, you can just start walking and this has shown that with increasing duration of walking, you are coming to a lot of protective influence. With a lower duration of walking, the relative risk of death from all causes was much, much higher. Another interesting part is that even when the person is walking quite a lot but the sedentary behavior as and when it keeps increasing, the sedentary behavior independently increased the risk of mortality from all causes. So, it is not only important that you exercise once or twice a day, it is a much better idea if you are able to incorporate exercise and physical activity as a part of your daily routine. So, instead of walking and instead of going by car, try and walk a bit. Try and park the car away a little bit. Coming to a cardiovascular risk, now 2000 kilocalories, the reason I have stuck with 2000 kilocalories is that"

                "text": "This is what aligns with most of the recommendations of physical activity. 39% lower risk of developing cardiovascular disease and deaths from cardiovascular diseases. Now, when we talk about how much it actually translates to, we have missed this bus. We were not really very wise in choosing our parents. But short of that, two things which have got a better risk protection than choosing our parents wisely would be exercise and total abstinence from cigarette. Other things which contribute, abolishing hypertension and management of obesity. So do not underestimate the power of simple movement and simple physical activity. This is from the ACLS. This tries to tell us that whatever physical activity you choose and whatever parameter choose, the physical activity in this case chosen has been running. But whatever parameter you choose and by extrapolation, whatever physical activity you choose, the protective influence is going to be almost equally good. So whether you are thinking in terms of the time or the distance covered or the speed that by which you are trying to run, everything turns out to be giving you a good amount of protective influence. So it is a very good idea to choose an activity you like. You choose the duration you like, choose the intensity you like, and we can go for the physical activity. And we can reap the benefits of lowered risk in either way. Now, diabetes mellitus deserves slightly special mention because the influence of exercise on diabetes is slightly different. Whereas in others, a dose-dependent reduction was seen, which was saturated. In diabetes, while it is a non-linear relation, the saturation effect does not completely even at a very, very high dose. At the same time, in diabetes, it has been observed that even small durations of activity which have been carried throughout the day are going to be very, very, very helpful. And diabetes is another aspect where sedentary behavior is known to be causing much greater damage than non-sedentary behavior. This is from a meta-analysis where I have tried to see the reduction in the different types of cancer. So the bladder cancer, the breast cancer, colon, endometrium, esophagus, kidney, stomach, and possibly liver cancer have got a lot of reduced risk due to regular physical activity, which happens mainly as a reduced reduction in anxiety, depression, and fatigue, and improved bone and sleep quality of life. We'll just be at a rest because we are trying to save a bit of the time. The cognitive functions, there has been a decent amount of proof that there is a lot of decreased risk of the development of depression. At the same time, it also helps in improving your cognition. To summarize that, we are finding that there's ample amount of evidence for lots and lots of conditions which tend to impact your lifestyle and tends to increase your overall longevity and tends to increase your quality of life. Over the next few slides, I'll actually try to summarize what I have presented. But this one particular slide from ACSM tries to give a lot of evidence of the prescriptive nature of exercise. And based on these aerobic activity, resistance activity, mind-body activity, and the balance training activity, they tend to work on all of these parameters. And this becomes a very good guideline in the future as far as the prescription of exercise is concerned. I will just skip through some of the rest of the slides. And we will come straight to the main point of longevity for everyone. Longevity does not merely mean adding years to your life. The most important point is adding life to years to decrease the burden of disease in the later part of your life. And this is where even a little bit of exercise can help you live longer and can help you live better. The guidelines, exercise whenever you can, 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of resistance activity per week is a very good beginning point. I'm not saying this is enough, but it's a very good beginning point. How to do that? Break it up into small things. Take the stairs. Walk during the breaks. Cycle to work. Small, small habits which can literally change your life. Exercise is medicine. I would like to leave with this particular slide, which I have taken from a couple of presentations from WHO.

        "summary": "Key Learnings and Insights:\n• Exercise is a crucial yet often overlooked component of longevity and health. It can serve both prescriptive and preventive roles in managing health, emphasizing the need for structured physical activity in daily routines.\n• Sedentary behavior significantly detracts from health and longevity. It is vital to recognize that while exercise promotes health, prolonged inactivity can lead to chronic diseases and reduced life expectancy.\n• Chronic diseases, particularly non-communicable diseases (NCDs), pose a significant burden, especially in low- and middle-income countries. For instance, 66% of deaths in India are attributable to NCDs, highlighting the urgent need for effective preventive measures.\n\nMain Discussion Points:\n• The distinction between physical activity and exercise is important; while all exercise is physical activity, not all physical activity qualifies as structured exercise. This differentiation is essential for understanding health recommendations.\n• Data from the Harvard Alumni Health Study and the Aerobic Centered Longitudinal Study reveal a strong inverse relationship between physical activity levels and mortality rates, with significant protective effects observed for both vigorous and moderate activities.\n• The increasing gap between life expectancy and healthy life expectancy underscores the need for interventions, with more individuals spending longer periods in poor health as they age.\n\nAction Items and Applications:\n• Implement small but impactful changes to increase daily physical activity, such as walking instead of driving short distances or taking stairs instead of elevators. These habits can contribute significantly to overall health.\n• Aim for a minimum of 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity each week. Breaking this down into manageable segments throughout the week can make it more achievable.\n• Utilize resources such as the ACSM guidelines to create personalized exercise prescriptions, integrating aerobic, resistance, mind-body, and balance training into regular routines for comprehensive health benefits."

I think we have, and also given the whole explosion of data science and AI that is happening in front of us, when you don't understand a very complex system, you try to just look at its representations and try to make sense of it. I think we will also have to do some of that as well. I think the opportunities are huge, and I do hope that you all will have excellent deliberations over the next couple of days, and over the years we will, of course, it's not going to be a magic pill for longevity. It will be many, many interventions. I think we will all have to also worry about education and public advocacy as well in this long term. Thank you, and have a wonderful day. Thank you. Thanks to Professor Natan, May I request our, please let me say a few words. Good morning honorable minister, the director of ISC, the dignitaries on the diocese, as well as all the participants at this, exciting and very opportune conference, not being hosted by the Longevity India program, RISE. For those of you who are not from the Bangalore ecosystem or from abroad, I see some of you international, ISC is a vibrant academic institution, an ecosystem that's thrived for 150 plus years, encompassing many aspects of science and engineering, and adjusting needs of the society as required. Beginning from researching antibiotics and vitamins and looking at standard load, or in the World War II type ecosystem, to the 21st century problem that society faced with a pandemic, where we researched on the virus, on antivirals, and developing diagnostic, ISC has always embraced very, very contemporary topics and brings to it the strength from multiple disciplines in science and engineering. So the questions which the Longevity India program and the RISE conference will demonstrate, or as my colleague Navkant mentioned, is something that's gripping us. We know that as a human species, we are getting longer, simply because that we know a lot better on how to handle infectious diseases. But this also comes with the flip side of the coin that non-communicable diseases are a threat. And therefore, one needs to research and understand in a deep way, how is it that us as a species can enjoy a healthy, longer life? And in this, a lot of research can be done both in model systems, as well as in the human population. So a multi-omics approach, a multi-disciplinary approach, like Navkant mentioned, where can that happen? I can't think of a better ecosystem than that at IISc, which has the depth in science, all aspects of science, biology, chemistry, all aspects of engineering, and bringing the best minds together can address something that we want to achieve for the well-being of humanity. Have a great evening, and I hope to join as many sessions as possible. Kriur Oson Can I request M thing Patented May I request Prime Minister Prashant Prakash, our founding patron for Rajavi T India and also part of the Excel group. For us form U the founding patron is important, so I request m thing just talks him to us a few words about his interest in this area and how we end up becoming the founding patron for this programme. Thank you. Prashant Prakash Thank you. So like other folks here, probably got into longevity science, starting with their work in laboratories and some of them in medical schools. My background is very different. I come from a computer science background and then systems engineering and systems modeling and then took my life, detours into venture capital and I founded the Excel, which is a global venture fund here in India. So we are kind of the preeminent global fund. But I think what here probably I want to share is how did I intersect paths with longevity and how did I get here? I think if I connect the dots back, I would take it, I kind of take my life back as a systems architect and computer architect and kind of remember those days when we would architect these systems and break up the complex systems into subsystems and then look at scale, look at architecture of these systems, resilience of these systems, interconnectedness of these systems, network architecture, I mean, sorry, the network effects of these systems. So fast forward probably two, three decades, kind of a little bit of COVID and also once you're 50 plus and getting to 60, you start also looking more closely at biology and what you left in college and high school and start really kind of relooking at a lot of that and then connect the dots with the idea that the problem with the current system, which you, of course, all of us are very familiar with, which is slightly more partitioned and siloed and I'm not speaking, I think everybody knows that, but I thought the real connection was with systems biology and I think the maturity of the systems biology space over the years, I think has happened at a time when AI is also gonna kind of make the transition of systems biology into mainstream. Systems biology itself was getting more mainstream, but to be able to get it into place in practice and to be able to get it actually into the real world, I think it wouldn't have been possible without generative AI. It's not only generative AI, I think it's a web of complex AI systems. You need classical reasoning AI systems, you need generative AI, you need what you call as quantitative language models, which is not systems that can deal with English, but systems that can deal with more complex medical data. So there's really a coming together of all of this and I think India is very uniquely positioned where we are at crossroads in our health system. We can, of course, we can retrace the steps and kind of catch up with what has happened in the West and we know what has happened with the health systems there or we have the path like we have done in digital finance, in many other areas, in mobile technologies, where can we make a new paradigm in health care for this country because we don't have a lot of health care and when you don't have a lot of health care, you have the luxury to build something which is not compromised by all kinds of insurance entities and all kinds of entities. So this kind of landscape where we'll be able to engineer something with AI and really the promise of AI of building something that has the potential to be a digital good of sorts in the context of health, I think is what got me into working with Deepak and starting Logivity here at IISc and then we need to translate all of this and that's where I founded BioPeak. So BioPeak is the one, is where you bring together advanced diagnostics, you bring together the ability to look at beyond blood work and look at more molecular pathways and molecular context and marry all of this in the context of AI and which is what BioPeak, and I think what BioPeak is doing is again, very cutting edge because in conscious medicine, there are things that you can do in the US and there are things that you can do in Singapore but I think there is a little bit more of an open opportunity here in India to define the standards for chemistry of medicine and we're working closely with folks in the Middle East, in Abu Dhabi and here to really set the standards for the next generation of healthcare. So it's very, very interesting and exciting times and I see some very familiar faces here who I've seen a lot online, Matt and Brian and their inspiration, Sachin is here, Sachin Pandya. So while in my own journey as a computer scientist to understand all of this, of course, all of them and the last I'd mention is Dennis Sarasavith who recently got the Nobel Prize. as a computer scientist, so we are entering an era where in the next 15 years, an AI agent will probably get a Nobel. So we are in very, very exciting times, where computer science will become kind of the glue that will bring everything together and we more, as computer scientists, I think we're more relevant, or as relevant as any other times. Very exciting. Thank you. Thank you very much for your remarks. May I request the Honourable Minister for Health and Family Welfare, Sri Ganesh Kongrela, to give some opening remarks. Thank you. It gives me great pleasure to be here for the longevity year. It is a great honour to be here and to be part of the conference, the Enabling Healthy Ageing. And all the people who are attending to discuss various aspects of ageing and how you can age in a healthy manner and live longer. And of course, with the rapid development of science and research, lifespans have increased and people are able to live much, much longer lives. And we are seeing all over the world that many people from many countries, there is an ageing population. And India, like what Prashant was just saying, we are somewhere in between. We are at the crossroads. We are not an ageing population because we still have demographic dividend on our side. And so, I think we have got a great opportunity here. The lifespan in India when we got independence was about, average lifespan was about 30-32 years. Today we are somewhere close to 70. So after 70 years, it is almost doubled. So if you can keep up the same age after another 75 years, we should be able to get to 140. Which may not be impossible. Which may be possible because there is so much happening in the field of medical science, biosciences and at the cellular level, non-cellular level, where we are not only talking about increasing the lifespan and how we can reduce ageing or slow down ageing but also reverse ageing. Where how we can not only stop ageing from happening but also how we can reverse the process of ageing. So there is, I think ultimately science may even find one day the ability to maybe achieve immortality also. We don't know. But definitely there is so much happening. And for a country like India where we have a huge population and our population will continue to grow for the next at least 30 years and I think our population is predicted to start reversing at the year 2060-2065. We are already at the TFR of 2.0 which is below 2.1. So we have been born below the replacement level. So definitely we have a demographic advantage as of now. And as the population ages, I think the biggest challenge is how we can make that aged population continue to lead fulfilling lives, continue to contribute to society, continue to be able to do things that they want to do and be able to do and achieve things and learn things even though you are getting older. And not just become like what we feel when we say when we get old that it's now a retired life. So that is something that I think is what we need to work on because we want people to continue to contribute. And that can happen if you are able to give a healthy life. Because not just a long life but it's the healthy life which makes it most important. And how we can improve the health of an individual. And how we can prevent onset of diseases or how we can change the way we are living so that we prepare ourselves for a long life ahead. And that starts from a young age. I think recently nationally there is a campaign going on against obesity. And there is so much awareness about the kind of lifestyle that we lead, the kind of food that we eat, the kind of approach we have and that there is a direct link between our lifestyle and the diseases that we are getting today. And so to be able to live a long and healthy life, I think it starts fundamentally from a young age. And if you are able to manage that well, if you are able to discipline yourself well and you are able to have good habits, I think most diseases today we are able to cure those diseases through medical science. Most of them at least. But as long as your basic health is good then you are able to lead fulfilling lives. At an old age you should be able to travel, you should be able to do things, you should be able to work, you should be able to study, you should be able to, you know, do everything that a person at a young age is doing. So, even if you are age of 75 or 80 or even 85, you should be ready to contribute to society. I think that's what as a government when we look at it. It should not be that age people are a burden or they are a cost of society. They should become in fact a contributing part of our society. And I think that's where longevity India, the slogan that they have is enabling healthy age people. So, this is what we need. We want people to be able to lead a healthy life. Not just a long life. And for that I am sure there are so many experts who have come over here. So many people who are, you know, experts in the field of medical science, bio science, nanotechnology, artificial intelligence, you know, quantum computing. All these things are coming together now. And so many things which were thought unimaginable earlier or not possible is what has become possible today. So, these kind of conferences I think will enhance our knowledge, enhance our capabilities to tackle the challenges that we are going to face in the future and how we can prepare ourselves. Because we have the advantage now of learning from what the west is doing, learning from what the east countries are doing and being able to apply it to our country. And so that's an advantage that we have. So, we should make use of that. And I am sure that, you know, these things will really help our society to be able to become, you know, more stronger and to be able to be a more fruitful society. A society which is active and dynamic. And I think this is great and I want to congratulate all the people who have thought about doing this. And this I am sure will be more such conferences, more such interactions and more such things will really happen. I am sure things are going to get much, much better for us. So, thank you for calling me. Sorry I am on a tight schedule. I need to go to the assembly and I am not able to spend much time. But definitely after your government gets over, I would definitely interact with the people over here and see what was the outcome of all the discussions we had and how we can use it in our own health policies in the state. How we can, you know, use some of the good things that come off from here and how we can use it in our government functioning and the things that we do in government. So, thank you very much. Thank you very much. It was pretty nice that actually something captured our intent and our strength in your speech. It is indeed the idea that we should promote activity aging. And especially in the context of India right now we claim to have a demographic dividend that we are a young country. And suddenly we want to look at staying with a large group of Asian people and that's where we think our initiative will make a difference. At this time it will be a pleasure to invite Rajesh Koshy sir to actually give some remarks and share his vision about film longevity with all of us. Thank you very much. Jalipati, Prime Minister, Srinivasa Muruganji, the Director ISE, Prof. Govindam Baradarajanji, Public Stage, Prof. Navakandi, Purshaji, Prashanthi, Jalipati, of the Stage, M.A.C, Srinivasa Muruganji and my colleagues from the Ministry of Finance, all the visiting participants. It is a pleasure and honour for me to be here. I did not complete what I was going to tell you. But I want to make a point from the perspective of government. Whenever we talk about health, whenever we think about any policy, we use the word health. the end of it, to the management of the disease, to the end of it, to the hospitals, but it's primarily to treat the diseases, but there is not much has been done to look at the health per se of an individual. So this is very important that we are assembling here to talk about the right for healthy aging and to look at this upcoming big problem for the aging population. From the Ayurveda perspective, it is interesting that there is a whole science of Prasayana talks about the aging population and how to provide a healthy aging or quality health for the aging population in the Prasayana. There are a couple of definitions. One is which means that the science or practice which helps optimizing all the tissues of the body and the other is which addresses the aging population, providing quality health and also cure the diseases. But when we talk about Prasayana, it is interesting that they don't just talk about some medicine or some products or some herbs. In addition to herbs, they talk about several lifestyle interventions. For example, yoga or sleep or the behavioral changes, they call it Acharya Prasayana. Acharya Prasayana means that how to behave, how to social connect, how to have a social life for the aging population. So there is a detailed description about how to provide quality health for the aging population. This is very interesting. We have started a lot of different work in this area. For example, we have our JNU colleagues sitting here. So there is a center of excellence in JNU and they have started an Ayurveda biology program leading to post-graduate MSc, Ayurveda biology. So Prashanthi was just mentioning systems biology. This is the core where all the other areas connect to understand this thing and we already have started this Ayurveda biology program and JNU, I compliment JNU and him here. We have another scientist sitting here who is from IGIB, Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology. She is an Ayurveda professional and working in IGIB and working to understand the mercury principles of Ayurveda and its connections with genomes. So such kind of things I also compliment Prof. Navakar having a CEO in center of excellence of IISc and working in different areas. So before I close, I want to start an interesting study which I saw when I was Vice Chancellor of Gujarat IIT University Jamnagar. We had a PhD student from Karnataka and he had taken a small study and it was on vayasthapana. Vayasthapana means the herbs which distorts the aging. So this vayasthapana, there are different herbs. There are three primary herbs. One is Amla, Amlaki, Gurji and another is Ashwagandha. So he said take these two herbs Amlaki and Gurji. Gurji is the Nospora codifolia and Amlaki is Indian rosemary, Amlika of Hristianalis. And he did this on lab on the Drosophilus. He studied Drosophilus. We all know that average lifespan of Drosophilus is 18 to 21 days. And he did this study having a control group and then the Drosophilus taking a standardized dose of Amlaki and another group taking Gurji. So the outcome was very interesting. It was a very small study but the outcome was very interesting. That the group taking Gurji lived for 88 days in place of 21 days. And the group who were taking Amlaki lived for 100 days. To be precise 109 days. So this showcases that we have a lot of strength to look at this possibility as all of you ministers said. Maybe we can live 140 years. It is possible. It is possible only through this network of networks of different sciences. That is the demand of the time. So I think both approach are good but fusion of both is required. Promotive and preventive and holistic. Fusion of productionist approach and holistic approach maybe we come out with some great solutions. Thank you so much for inviting me. Thank you very much for those interesting insights. The point which I really like what you mentioned is that we need to transition from sick care to health care and from a reductionist approach to a holistic approach. And I think that should be the premise of every age group. We start treating an individual as bigger than some of the organs in our body. Which is what a time treatment plan creates. That we treat one organ and we talk about body as a whole. Thank you so much. We request Professor Rangarajan to give his remarks and recommendations to the scientists. Good morning everyone. Let me welcome all of you. Especially those from outside IAC. I hope you have a productive two days of discussion during this conference. I think this is a very important conference as others have stressed. Aging, even though it may at first glance appear to be a problem that concerns India. Given the average age is quite low in India. But we have already about 150 million people who are above the age of 60. And so in absolute numbers, the number of people who are above 60 is very large. So therefore we need to tackle this problem and ensure that they all have a healthy lifespan. So I think this conference is quite apt and appropriate for understanding not just global issues in Asia. But in particular the issues related to aging in India. And also I would like to take this opportunity to announce that NPMR, the Indian Centre for Medical Research, is supporting the LGBT India with a 5-year project by making this into a Centre for Advanced Research. So this really is a big boost for this whole venture. And this Centre for Advanced Research will focus on, of course, aging. But also look at novel models for modeling aging. And look at the aging axis and things like that. And it involves 5 departments. Other than the biology department, it also includes computer science and materials engineering. Again highlighting the fact that every subject that we study now has become truly interdisciplinary. So this is nothing like some new subject which can be studied in a single department. So I am really happy with this development. And I am sure it will lead to further progress in the study of the aging. Thank you all. Thank you so much, Dr. Gangarajan. I think we are in time and that shows that we are running a very tight ship here. And thank you everyone on the stage for gracing this occasion. And we really appreciate your time, which is very precious for all the meetings. Come here and actually give your kind words for this meeting. I request Dr. Gangarajan to hand over some mentions to the rest of you. Okay. Kirish Kundula. Thank you, Rajesh. Mr. Prashant Prakash. Mr. Nampak. We were sorry. Diolch yn fawr iawn. Diolch yn fawr iawn. Diolch yn fawr iawn. Diolch yn fawr iawn.",

                "text": "can learn from different disciplines. I think we have, and also given the whole explosion of data science and AI that is happening in front of us, when you don't understand a very complex system, you try to just look at its representations and try to make sense of it. I think we will also have to do some of that as well. I think the opportunities are huge, and I do hope that you all will have excellent deliberations over the next couple of days, and over the years we will, of course, it's not going to be a magic pill for longevity. It will be many, many interventions. I think we will all have to also worry about education and public advocacy as well in this long term. Thank you, and have a wonderful day. Thank you. Thanks to Professor Natan, May I request our, please let me say a few words. Good morning honorable minister, the director of ISC, the dignitaries on the diocese, as well as all the participants at this, exciting and very opportune conference, not being hosted by the Longevity India program, RISE. For those of you who are not from the Bangalore ecosystem or from abroad, I see some of you international, ISC is a vibrant academic institution, an ecosystem that's thrived for 150 plus years, encompassing many aspects of science and engineering, and adjusting needs of the society as required. Beginning from researching antibiotics and vitamins and looking at standard load, or in the World War II type ecosystem, to the 21st century problem that society faced with a pandemic, where we researched on the virus, on antivirals, and developing diagnostic, ISC has always embraced very, very contemporary topics and brings to it the strength from multiple disciplines in science and engineering. So the questions which the Longevity India program and the RISE conference will demonstrate, or as my colleague Navkant mentioned, is something that's gripping us. We know that as a human species, we are getting longer, simply because that we know a lot better on how to handle infectious diseases. But this also comes with the flip side of the coin that non-communicable diseases are a threat. And therefore, one needs to research and understand in a deep way, how is it that us as a species can enjoy a healthy, longer life? And in this, a lot of research can be done both in model systems, as well as in the human population. So a multi-omics approach, a multi-disciplinary approach, like Navkant mentioned, where can that happen? I can't think of a better ecosystem than that at IISc, which has the depth in science, all aspects of science, biology, chemistry, all aspects of engineering, and bringing the best minds together can address something that we want to achieve for the well-being of humanity. Have a great evening, and I hope to join as many sessions as possible. Kriur Oson Can I request M thing Patented May I request Prime Minister Prashant Prakash, our founding patron for Rajavi T India and also part of the Excel group. For us form U the founding patron is important, so I request m thing just talks him to us a few words about his interest in this area and how we end up becoming the founding patron for this programme. Thank you. Prashant Prakash Thank you. So like other folks here, probably got into longevity science, starting with their work in laboratories and some of them in medical schools. My background is very different. I come from a computer science background and then systems engineering and systems modeling and then took my life, detours into venture capital and I founded the Excel, which is a global venture fund here in India. So we are kind of the preeminent global fund. But I think what here probably I want to share is how did I intersect paths with longevity and how did I get here? I think if I connect the dots back, I would take it, I kind of take my life back as a systems architect and computer architect and kind of remember those days when we would architect these systems and break up the complex systems into subsystems and then look at scale, look at architecture of these systems, resilience of these systems, interconnectedness of these systems, network architecture, I mean, sorry, the network effects of these systems. So fast forward probably two, three decades, kind of a little bit of COVID and also once you're 50 plus and getting to 60, you start also looking more closely at biology and what you left in college and high school and start really kind of relooking at a lot of that and then connect the dots with the idea that the problem with the current system, which you, of course, all of us are very familiar with, which is slightly more partitioned and siloed and I'm not speaking, I think everybody knows that, but I thought the real connection was with systems biology and I think the maturity of the systems biology space over the years, I think has happened at a time when AI is also gonna kind of make the transition of systems biology into mainstream. Systems biology itself was getting more mainstream, but to be able to get it into place in practice and to be able to get it actually into the real world, I think it wouldn't have been possible without generative AI. It's not only generative AI, I think it's a web of complex AI systems. You need classical reasoning AI systems, you need generative AI, you need what you call as quantitative language models, which is not systems that can deal with English, but systems that can deal with more complex medical data. So there's really a coming together of all of this and I think India is very uniquely positioned where we are at crossroads in our health system. We can, of course, we can retrace the steps and kind of catch up with what has happened in the West and we know what has happened with the health systems there or we have the path like we have done in digital finance, in many other areas, in mobile technologies, where can we make a new paradigm in health care for this country because we don't have a lot of health care and when you don't have a lot of health care, you have the luxury to build something which is not compromised by all kinds of insurance entities and all kinds of entities. So this kind of landscape where we'll be able to engineer something with AI and really the promise of AI of building something that has the potential to be a digital good of sorts in the context of health, I think is what got me into working with Deepak and starting Logivity here at IISc and then we need to translate all of this and that's where I founded BioPeak. So BioPeak is the one, is where you bring together advanced diagnostics, you bring together the ability to look at beyond blood work and look at more molecular pathways and molecular context and marry all of this in the context of AI and which is what BioPeak, and I think what BioPeak is doing is again, very cutting edge because in conscious medicine, there are things that you can do in the US and there are things that you can do in Singapore but I think there is a little bit more of an open opportunity here in India to define the standards for chemistry of medicine and we're working closely with folks in the Middle East, in Abu Dhabi and here to really set the standards for the next generation of healthcare. So it's very, very interesting and exciting times and I see some very familiar faces here who I've seen a lot online, Matt and Brian and their inspiration, Sachin is here, Sachin Pandya. So while in my own journey as a computer scientist to understand all of this, of course, all of them and the last I'd mention is Dennis Sarasavith who recently got the Nobel Prize."

                "text": "as a computer scientist, so we are entering an era where in the next 15 years, an AI agent will probably get a Nobel. So we are in very, very exciting times, where computer science will become kind of the glue that will bring everything together and we more, as computer scientists, I think we're more relevant, or as relevant as any other times. Very exciting. Thank you. Thank you very much for your remarks. May I request the Honourable Minister for Health and Family Welfare, Sri Ganesh Kongrela, to give some opening remarks. Thank you. It gives me great pleasure to be here for the longevity year. It is a great honour to be here and to be part of the conference, the Enabling Healthy Ageing. And all the people who are attending to discuss various aspects of ageing and how you can age in a healthy manner and live longer. And of course, with the rapid development of science and research, lifespans have increased and people are able to live much, much longer lives. And we are seeing all over the world that many people from many countries, there is an ageing population. And India, like what Prashant was just saying, we are somewhere in between. We are at the crossroads. We are not an ageing population because we still have demographic dividend on our side. And so, I think we have got a great opportunity here. The lifespan in India when we got independence was about, average lifespan was about 30-32 years. Today we are somewhere close to 70. So after 70 years, it is almost doubled. So if you can keep up the same age after another 75 years, we should be able to get to 140. Which may not be impossible. Which may be possible because there is so much happening in the field of medical science, biosciences and at the cellular level, non-cellular level, where we are not only talking about increasing the lifespan and how we can reduce ageing or slow down ageing but also reverse ageing. Where how we can not only stop ageing from happening but also how we can reverse the process of ageing. So there is, I think ultimately science may even find one day the ability to maybe achieve immortality also. We don't know. But definitely there is so much happening. And for a country like India where we have a huge population and our population will continue to grow for the next at least 30 years and I think our population is predicted to start reversing at the year 2060-2065. We are already at the TFR of 2.0 which is below 2.1. So we have been born below the replacement level. So definitely we have a demographic advantage as of now. And as the population ages, I think the biggest challenge is how we can make that aged population continue to lead fulfilling lives, continue to contribute to society, continue to be able to do things that they want to do and be able to do and achieve things and learn things even though you are getting older. And not just become like what we feel when we say when we get old that it's now a retired life. So that is something that I think is what we need to work on because we want people to continue to contribute. And that can happen if you are able to give a healthy life. Because not just a long life but it's the healthy life which makes it most important. And how we can improve the health of an individual. And how we can prevent onset of diseases or how we can change the way we are living so that we prepare ourselves for a long life ahead. And that starts from a young age. I think recently nationally there is a campaign going on against obesity. And there is so much awareness about the kind of lifestyle that we lead, the kind of food that we eat, the kind of approach we have and that there is a direct link between our lifestyle and the diseases that we are getting today. And so to be able to live a long and healthy life, I think it starts fundamentally from a young age. And if you are able to manage that well, if you are able to discipline yourself well and you are able to have good habits, I think most diseases today we are able to cure those diseases through medical science. Most of them at least. But as long as your basic health is good then you are able to lead fulfilling lives. At an old age you should be able to travel, you should be able to do things, you should be able to work, you should be able to study, you should be able to, you know, do everything that a person at a young age is doing. So, even if you are age of 75 or 80 or even 85, you should be ready to contribute to society. I think that's what as a government when we look at it. It should not be that age people are a burden or they are a cost of society. They should become in fact a contributing part of our society. And I think that's where longevity India, the slogan that they have is enabling healthy age people. So, this is what we need. We want people to be able to lead a healthy life. Not just a long life. And for that I am sure there are so many experts who have come over here. So many people who are, you know, experts in the field of medical science, bio science, nanotechnology, artificial intelligence, you know, quantum computing. All these things are coming together now. And so many things which were thought unimaginable earlier or not possible is what has become possible today. So, these kind of conferences I think will enhance our knowledge, enhance our capabilities to tackle the challenges that we are going to face in the future and how we can prepare ourselves. Because we have the advantage now of learning from what the west is doing, learning from what the east countries are doing and being able to apply it to our country. And so that's an advantage that we have. So, we should make use of that. And I am sure that, you know, these things will really help our society to be able to become, you know, more stronger and to be able to be a more fruitful society. A society which is active and dynamic. And I think this is great and I want to congratulate all the people who have thought about doing this. And this I am sure will be more such conferences, more such interactions and more such things will really happen. I am sure things are going to get much, much better for us. So, thank you for calling me. Sorry I am on a tight schedule. I need to go to the assembly and I am not able to spend much time. But definitely after your government gets over, I would definitely interact with the people over here and see what was the outcome of all the discussions we had and how we can use it in our own health policies in the state. How we can, you know, use some of the good things that come off from here and how we can use it in our government functioning and the things that we do in government. So, thank you very much. Thank you very much. It was pretty nice that actually something captured our intent and our strength in your speech. It is indeed the idea that we should promote activity aging. And especially in the context of India right now we claim to have a demographic dividend that we are a young country. And suddenly we want to look at staying with a large group of Asian people and that's where we think our initiative will make a difference. At this time it will be a pleasure to invite Rajesh Koshy sir to actually give some remarks and share his vision about film longevity with all of us. Thank you very much. Jalipati, Prime Minister, Srinivasa Muruganji, the Director ISE, Prof. Govindam Baradarajanji, Public Stage, Prof. Navakandi, Purshaji, Prashanthi, Jalipati, of the Stage, M.A.C, Srinivasa Muruganji and my colleagues from the Ministry of Finance, all the visiting participants. It is a pleasure and honour for me to be here. I did not complete what I was going to tell you. But I want to make a point from the perspective of government. Whenever we talk about health, whenever we think about any policy, we use the word health."

                "text": "the end of it, to the management of the disease, to the end of it, to the hospitals, but it's primarily to treat the diseases, but there is not much has been done to look at the health per se of an individual. So this is very important that we are assembling here to talk about the right for healthy aging and to look at this upcoming big problem for the aging population. From the Ayurveda perspective, it is interesting that there is a whole science of Prasayana talks about the aging population and how to provide a healthy aging or quality health for the aging population in the Prasayana. There are a couple of definitions. One is which means that the science or practice which helps optimizing all the tissues of the body and the other is which addresses the aging population, providing quality health and also cure the diseases. But when we talk about Prasayana, it is interesting that they don't just talk about some medicine or some products or some herbs. In addition to herbs, they talk about several lifestyle interventions. For example, yoga or sleep or the behavioral changes, they call it Acharya Prasayana. Acharya Prasayana means that how to behave, how to social connect, how to have a social life for the aging population. So there is a detailed description about how to provide quality health for the aging population. This is very interesting. We have started a lot of different work in this area. For example, we have our JNU colleagues sitting here. So there is a center of excellence in JNU and they have started an Ayurveda biology program leading to post-graduate MSc, Ayurveda biology. So Prashanthi was just mentioning systems biology. This is the core where all the other areas connect to understand this thing and we already have started this Ayurveda biology program and JNU, I compliment JNU and him here. We have another scientist sitting here who is from IGIB, Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology. She is an Ayurveda professional and working in IGIB and working to understand the mercury principles of Ayurveda and its connections with genomes. So such kind of things I also compliment Prof. Navakar having a CEO in center of excellence of IISc and working in different areas. So before I close, I want to start an interesting study which I saw when I was Vice Chancellor of Gujarat IIT University Jamnagar. We had a PhD student from Karnataka and he had taken a small study and it was on vayasthapana. Vayasthapana means the herbs which distorts the aging. So this vayasthapana, there are different herbs. There are three primary herbs. One is Amla, Amlaki, Gurji and another is Ashwagandha. So he said take these two herbs Amlaki and Gurji. Gurji is the Nospora codifolia and Amlaki is Indian rosemary, Amlika of Hristianalis. And he did this on lab on the Drosophilus. He studied Drosophilus. We all know that average lifespan of Drosophilus is 18 to 21 days. And he did this study having a control group and then the Drosophilus taking a standardized dose of Amlaki and another group taking Gurji. So the outcome was very interesting. It was a very small study but the outcome was very interesting. That the group taking Gurji lived for 88 days in place of 21 days. And the group who were taking Amlaki lived for 100 days. To be precise 109 days. So this showcases that we have a lot of strength to look at this possibility as all of you ministers said. Maybe we can live 140 years. It is possible. It is possible only through this network of networks of different sciences. That is the demand of the time. So I think both approach are good but fusion of both is required. Promotive and preventive and holistic. Fusion of productionist approach and holistic approach maybe we come out with some great solutions. Thank you so much for inviting me. Thank you very much for those interesting insights. The point which I really like what you mentioned is that we need to transition from sick care to health care and from a reductionist approach to a holistic approach. And I think that should be the premise of every age group. We start treating an individual as bigger than some of the organs in our body. Which is what a time treatment plan creates.

        "full_text": "So, keeping that thing in our mind, you know, we have designed two panels. One is we are going to talk about, you know, discuss personalized Ayurveda for healthy aging, and how we can bridge the traditional knowledge with the clinical practice. And another is going to be a biohacking, biohacking aging, can Ayurveda and the modern find out the secret of longevity. I think these two panels, it's going to be a pretty good segue for what has been presented here. So, if you look at the aging, it's a very complex, multifaceted process influenced by our genetics, lifestyle, and environment. While, if you look at the modern medicine, it seeks to decode the longevity through technology, data. But if you look at the Ayurveda, it has provided a very personalized, holistic approach to aging for millennia. As you said, the yoga, how it's changing the gray matter, which is changing, you know, how it's being affected. But if you look at, you know, the principle behind those things, how they are interconnected, can we really put these together and use it to maintain the, you know, fidelity or prevent the age-related decline? So our first panel is going to just deliberate on this. And I want to start with, you know, inviting our esteemed panelist, Dr. M. Srikant, he's a Deputy Director in CCRS, which is funding a very active and proactive mode. And then, second panelist is Professor Rana Pisi, he's a professor in the School of… Okay, so we are starting with the second one. So we will start with the second one. So we will start with the biohacking, biohacking aging. Can Ayurveda and the modern science unlock the secret of longevity? So if I would like to invite our panelist, Dr. Kaustubh Upadhyay, he's an advisor in So, you know, my first question is with Dr. Kaustubh Upadhyay, if you look at the biohacking, which enhances the human performance and longevity through lifestyle modifications, diet and technology, Ayurveda with some limited, you know, time-tested practices like Utsayana, which we just saw, Vicharya and herbal therapy, has been optimizing our health for centuries. And especially in a context of fundamental of Ayurveda, like the Prakriti Agni and other things. Do you think, can Ayurvedic principles and methodology serve as a natural blueprint for achieving a healthy aging and longevity? If yes, then how we can merge both sciences together? In Ayurveda, we believe, what we know is very minute. What we don't know is a huge universe. So this we have to understand. That's why, while deducting Ayurveda, how Ayurveda, Brahma Svatpa, means the knowledge is there in the universe. We are just capturing. It's an observational science. So, if you want to find out each and every molecule and test it in various disorders or various problem areas, it's a Herculean job. So, how people, Ayurvedic people first got it? The principle says, Ayurveda, it's a nature selection. Nature tells you what is the Ayurveda. Ayurveda is Krishna. How it comes? Kurvate hi vichim dosa hai, parikra samanaya. Body system is like that. When something is disturbed in your body, body will demand. It will create a demand. That demand we have to recognize. So, our mental peace, if it is there, we will be able to appreciate it. Otherwise, we can't know what our stomach is asking, what our tongue is asking. So, if we are able to make that, differentiate, our body will tell what is medicine for us. So, most of the observations, even including proper observations, are done by the observation of animals. Animal, suppose you have a cat, you have a dog in the house, it gets disturbed. It will go and eat the grass and it will vomit out and it will get dizzy. Isn't it? It's in nature. So, for example, Shilajatu we are using since 4,000-5,000 years. One scientist who came here in India for some tourism issue, he observed some monkeys in certain range of Himalayas. They are very healthy. It is not same with the monkeys which are above that range and below that range. Then, he was keen and he start observed. And he saw that monkeys are going to cracks, rocks, spaces and scratch that surface and eating it. Then, they found what it is. It was Shilajatu what we are using in Ayurveda since ages. So, who has thought that monkey, that this has helped at the prolongation of age. So, these are all the knowledge systems which are there. This is a record. Whatever recorded in various traditional medicine sciences, it is a record observation that are documented. And that has been practiced. What we are practicing is not 2%. I believe people. And what modern science takes for research, it is fraction. 0.00001% of what we are following. So, we say what is the gap? Unless we entirely make a research with taking all the aspects together, we will not be able to contribute much to the science. We have almost past 75 years after independence. What is the original contribution to the medical science from India? Can we count in fingers? Not below 1 or 2. This is because we as a population, civilization, we were having original thinking from the days beginning. So, civilization starts from the questioning. Now, in our whatever education system, our thought process, we stop questioning everything. Without questioning, first question. So, that question should fit behind any bias. We say, we should not have any biases. That is the null hypothesis is the basis for any research. But we forget that. For every research protocol, we have a bias. So, that bias we bring and we will say we have null hypothesis. So, that bias we have to remove. Second. Tappa means you have to do hard work. Research takes lot of dedication and hard work. That you should commit. And if you put that, then nana will come automatically. Then you will come out with the research outputs which will be useful for the society. Bioprospecting in Ayurveda is the very useful tool. Without that, it will be like finding the needle in the sand. That is my observation, my opinion. Thank you. Thank you so much. That brings us to the next question. Because, you know, if you look at the biohacking, which is a modern way to enhance our, you know, reducing aging, enhancing longevity. And that's a concept of biohacking, if you think about it. If you look at that, it focuses more on the data-driven physiological optimization. Whereas, if you look at Ayurveda, it's a more holistic, system-based approach to well-being. How crucial it is, a question to Professor Bhushan Patwardhan, sir. How it's crucial to decipher the underlying biological mechanism of the Ayurvedic principles. Such as the metabolic regulation, or neuroplasticity, or immunomodulation. Which, if you look into the Ayurveda, talks about, you know, yoga, or agni, or, you know, oj, so on. This concept, to integrate the ancient wisdom with the modern biohacking movement. So that they both could mix and culminate in a better understanding. And take us to the, you know, start a new era. Thank you, Dr. Gopesh. And thank you for this question. Because I wanted to talk about this term, biohacking, itself. Because biohacking, to me, is oxymoron. And ethical biohacking is even more oxymoron. Because, and I saw one book, you know, on hacking health. And I say, what the heck? What do you mean? Because hacking, if you look at the dictionary meaning of hacking also, it is something which is unauthorized. And ethical hacking, grey hat hacking or white hat hacking, you know, these are some very, very weird concepts which are coming in our system. I would say that if you want to modulate your response, you should go to Dr. Upadhyay or Dr. Shrikant or Dr. Bhavna and ask them or Sunocharya also can tell you what is Dinacharya, what is Uttucharya. You know, you don't have to really go into this kind of a terminology which is actually not correct terminology. And they are taking, trying to take us in the wrong path. Means I have seen some of the lifestyle, so called lifestyle, what do they call themselves? Coaches. Lifestyle coaches. Giving advice to people that if you want to have health, you know, you should really in the evening have a good exercise, then have a warm water bath and then have dinner. But this is completely opposite to what Ayurveda is trying to tell you, you know. So, this is not the way. So, world actually is looking for an authentic, credible advice. And not something which is so called pseudo fashionable advice, you know. We should be very careful. So, here Ayurveda has a great role to play. Because Ayurvedic advices are based on the experiences. They are not short term experiences. They are coming from a very very long term experiences which are tested. Which are tested in people and not just in the laboratory. Because in science unfortunately, Dr. Gupta, both of us we come from a science background, you know. And we are taught that what we see, what we hear, what we measure is only truth. Because our science is based on empiricism. And we are sitting now in Indian Institute of Science. So, I must talk about it. And in the book actually I have made this point that and the subtitle of my book, Genome to Om is Evolving Journey of Modern Science to Meta Science. So, it is actually a journey from Jnan, Vidyan to Prajnan. So, he was making a point that who tells all this? This is the Prajnan. Who is telling that mosquito, who taught that mosquito to come here and exactly bite you in the night time when you don't know that she is biting you? Who is telling? Who is telling those migratory birds, you know? Who is telling that tortoise to tag a geotag and come back? So, this is something which we cannot explain today. We may explain by way of science. The experiments are evolving. So, we may do that. But essentially there is something which is beyond which we cannot really explain or measure today. It doesn't mean that it doesn't exist. We are not able to really measure it today. It doesn't mean that tomorrow we may not be able to measure it or know it. And in history of science, you will see hundreds of such examples. We were thinking that something is impossible yesterday. Today we are able to do it very easily. So, science is ever evolving. Second important point which he made is curiosity driven. Science is curiosity driven, questioning driven, you know. And we have actually stopped thinking. We are living today in a thinking deficient society. And couple of weeks ago Nature published an article. You may have read that. And the title of the article is Scientists need time to think. So, why scientists? Everybody need time to think. Today kids don't have time to think in the school, you know. So, this is the world we are living in today. And so, when we are talking about modifying ourselves to face today's modern problems, you know, modern problems cannot be resolved by only modern methods. And we will have to go for the methods which are tested, which are time tested, which are coming from not only Ayurveda and Yoga but there are several other knowledge sources also which can bring in them. And healthy ageing. I think healthy ageing, first of all ageing is a natural process. We have to make it very healthy. By way of adopting our own lifestyle, our own diet, how can we remain healthy by eating the kind of food we are eating today? How can we be healthy if we are following the lifestyle which we are following today? So, we will have to make lot of changes. And we will have to make lot of disruptive changes in our own behaviours. And that will come, I think, through this. I hope that RISE will able to really bring that very very effectively because it is happening with the right people at the right place. As I told you in the morning, we need role models, you know. And RISE will become such role models for this change. But not through hacking. Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir. Very, you know, heart-broken because if you look at how the longevity in society, they are practising, this is one of the things, and I completely agree with that, we don't have to hack it, we have to really improvise it. So, my third question is, you know, with Dr. Mahna Parasar, if you look at the way, right now, M.G.T. clinics or other, they are practising this, looking and doing a lot of different types of genetic testing and then biomatrix analysis, which has a huge multi-microphonics, you know, components, it costs a lot. But if you look at the Ayurveda, which categorises a human extreme constituents, Prakrit type and then Agni, how do you think that where is the point where Tridosh and all these concepts can reconcile with, you know, biomatrix technology and create something which is new, more universal and more useful? So, I think, as you rightly said, we have a lot of tests and multiple things. As in the morning, you know, Gyan's talk was, you mentioned that we have many verticals of diagnostic parameters, positive factors, therapeutic options, we have very little interconnectedness. And I think that's where Ayurveda's interconnectedness, am I audible? So, that's where I think Ayurveda's Trisutra framework, which is essentially an interconnectedness between positive factors, clinical manifestations and corresponding therapeutic manifestations, therapeutic interventions, and that it is able to give because it connects with external environment and internal environment, with common language of Tridosha and that's very much a practical thing to do. Second thing is having analysed Tridosha in the clinical phenotypes, it also tells about the vulnerabilities and robustness, both patterns. It's called Khavegunya. Different Prakriti will have different susceptibilities based on their organ systems, strength and accordingly. So, that can help in identification of markers also. And accordingly, why we are worried about markers? Because then you can pinpointedly select the corresponding Dosha pacifying medicines to test on only those aspects rather than everything going everywhere and no dots getting connected. So, the example that I gave of the DNA type repair and the hypoxia and all, it tells that these are the things which are more predominantly observed in one Prakriti versus the other. So, corresponding Dosha pacifying medicines might actually have, and we have also proven with one of the herbs, Datura Vasika on hypoxia. Second thing is that when you are saying, so biohacking or maybe I can say that if people who are, in all our biology, we have metabolic processes going on, metabolic processes giving rise to something which is to be excreted out and or maybe cleared out of the system. So, we have all systems in place to clear out. If there is a system for genesis, there is a system for clearing out also. But when the second one is going down and other one, the production of waste or for that matter, even program said and if it goes beyond certain rates, the clearance is not happening and we are also seeing self-re-DNA like conditions in circulating blood which is causing a lot of inflammatory response. We have also got apoptosis to be matched with the atherocytosis to clear out all the things that have been thrown out in the system. Likewise, we also have biotoxins in our system. Ayurveda talks about Rasayan therapy, not just start giving good things one after the other and too many good things might not even actually eventually have the beneficial effects. It first talks about clearing out mechanism. So, something which is regularly happening is fine but if it is not happening, you provide it. So I think these are the concepts which will actually enable the integration of Vatik-Kaf based analysis plus Vatik-Kaf based or Shada selections to be able to take care of the aging process. Thank you, Ma'am. I think that brings me to the next question. You know, if you look at the way the modern, what they call it, biohacking, you know, so what they do, there's an emphasis on the, you know, different type of chemicals, including a caffeine, a monophenol, a synthetic peptide to enhance the brain function. Whereas if you look at, you know, the Ayurveda, it offers adoptogens, and I think, you know, in one presentation they showed how the adoptogen can enhance our brain functionality also. So how do you think that, you know, in terms of popularizing this, because you have the one which is getting a lot of popularity, the other one is, you know, we were talking about how we are going to integrate this, because there's always a question of long-term safety and efficacy with, you know, with natural medicine. So how, so how you think that that can be merged together? This may be a right question to a wrong person. Anyway, I would like to take a diversion, a little bit of diversion from the question. Don't think I'm dodging the question. You may ask this question to a right person. Probably, but I felt, I was there from the beginning listening to all the experts. One area that was not discussed was diet, aahar. Generally, Dr. Bhawana talks about Prakriti and aahar, but she did not mention that, maybe because of the paucity of time, and I'm sure even the audience doesn't want to speak about diet now, because after having such a delicious lunch and tea, the same, the same scenario prevails in research in the area of Ayurvedic aahar. Not much has been done. If you look at the literature, already available, they are generally a literature review, even in public, you see, or maybe some ingredients, food ingredients like garlic in dyslipidemia or the anti-inflammatory activity of turmeric, but food as a whole, as such a healthy diet is, what is healthy? One, healthy for me, may not be healthy for Dr. Bhawana. So, what is healthy for, so customized diet, so that's another area. Some people say, drink two liters of water, three liters of water, but somebody else says, no, that much of water is not good. Somebody says, hot water is good. No, I like cold water. I'm fine with cold water. I'm doing well, even after having cold water. Or we say in Ayurveda, cold is not good in general. So, buttermilk is better. So, what kind of study or evidence we have, that is one area where we need to focus a lot and in the area of food, there are several different aspects, like rasa. One particular rasa is vatakara or kafahara. So, then how to identify rasa? One that is sweet to me, may not be that sweet to others. So, there are several angles of that. Even the healthy food, milk, they say it's universally healthy, but it doesn't suit many people. So, this is what I feel. And one of the mandates of my institution, Central Ayurveda Research Institute, located in Bangalore. We are under the Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences, Ministry of Ayurveda of India. We are supposed to work in the area of dietetics. I see many young and intelligent people here. And any idea about research on dietetics in particular are welcome. We have a tie-up with CFTRI in Mysore, sir. In Ayurveda books, many formulations are mentioned too, but in what proportion they should be mixed or for how long they should be heated or boiled. So, that is not there. That's absent. So, to develop a formulation and also see their efficacy on animals. So, that's an effort we have initiated. That study is going on. We could develop 10 different formulations that were mentioned. In different dosage forms, we have developed ready-to-put kind of thing. So, this is just a general idea about what I wanted to express in this forum. Thank you. I am pleased to share diets with my parents and also my friend. Thank you. Taking further what she said about the differential suitability towards different dietary conditions. It also goes well for differential restrictive time eating. Because sometimes people say 2 meals a day is very good. Sometimes they say 6 meals. So, where do we reconcile all these things? Again, coming back to prakriti. People with prakriti cannot have 2 meals a day. Likewise, if calf prakriti is asked to eat every now and then, they will end up in metabolic dysregulation. So, I think there is nothing good for everyone. There has to be consideration of inter-individual variability. Especially in inter-metabolic patterns to be able to get the best benefits out of it. Even intermittent fasting may not suit everyone. However, good results there may be for intermittent fasting. So, very well said. One more information. FSSAI has published Ayurveda Aadhaar Guidelines in 2021. Anybody who is interested can go through and it says what are the… No, no, not… If you want to manufacture and sell any product in the name of Ayurveda, there are some regulations. Sir, can I ask a question? Yes, sure. The present trend in modern research is whatever non-molecules you want to correlate and keep great to that molecule, all they affect what we are ascribing to that particular drug as a whole. But each and every drug contains 50, 60, 100 types of phytomolecules. And we don't know which one is actually giving the result. So, before making, drawing conclusions without surveying everything, it is a disservice to the science. So, my request is while doing the integrated research where AYUSH component is involved, I want before finalizing the protocol, there should be a discussion regarding both the scientists should openly discuss various aspects and without taking the principles of Ayurveda and taking one particular drug will not serve. For example, in 50s and 60s, Reserpine is the only compound for BP, hypertension. But what happened after 20 years? But now, even today, Ayurvedic people are using Sarpagandha and they are giving results and no side effects whatever reported for Reserpine is coming in the Sarpagandha as a whole. So, these types of things are there. So, that reductionist approach should be carefully watched and making drawing conclusions. I have a reservation in conclusions drawn by most of the research works happening across the country. I have a very strong reservation on those conclusions because that bias, removing bias when you do that, those conclusions do not match with whatever work we have done. Because in biological research, control of environment is very challenging job. We are actually not able to control everything in biological world. So, lot of dependency will be there. Body will respond to each and every stimuli at every moment and body is exposed to so many other factors also. So, that control, what we say, is a misnomer in biological world. So, that we have to be careful in doing biomedical research. So, this brings to the end of the session. But with one question, I think I would like you all to answer that. Because if you look at what we call modern or conventional medicine which is going on right now, it is pretty much in a binary nature. You look at the diagnostics and then you try to correlate it. Sometimes there is no correlations. But if you look at Ayurveda, which is more holistic, more complex. So, what kind of a framework we can prepare which can accommodate both? First question is, is there a possibility that we can convert these two divergent pathways? And if we can do, what will be the framework and how we are going to achieve it? Possibility is always there. You have seen, I forgot the name. Hemant's presentation. सिधाति योका invited भावत त्रेक लयह arena He was given the representatives स्नावी्शन मुच्क � Speaking पास्य 궁ण But it's not more than four विच्चर舉सन सभी जी से दर्ध दे Ecstatic वाटक도र असानत जिनकों जी एंगादासिना Obedience Obey I am looking after the grants given to various research protocols. Protocols are fully designed in IISC research and that needs to be a serious attention of researchers from all across, from IISC, as well as partners. Thank you sir. It is possible and we have examples of those who are doing it successfully. The Neemak story we saw and I think when the physician-scientists like Dr. Srikanth are sitting here, they grow in number, this will automatically happen. Today a doctor was passed out from AIIMS, he is doing this kind of a treatment, no diabetes he is talking about, you know. Diabetes treatment, as a drug researcher I can tell you that if we dream that we will find out some magic bullet which will attack one target and one molecule and we will be able to control diabetes, impossible. It is absolutely not possible because it is a polygenic disease and we can't do that. But there are certain good things in allopathy as well. If you have to have quick fixes, you know, if you want immediate, if somebody is having chest pain or suspected any kind of a cardiac problem, we can't tell him to go to him and do yoga, you know, you have to go to a cardiologist and check. So this call will have to be taken and doctors will have to be more like guardians of health rather than only looking at public symptoms and quickly fixing them. And Ayurveda yoga, they can bring in solid support for non-pharmacological injuries. You spoke and we have been undermining this non-pharmacological part for quite some time and that is probably, not probably, mostly because of the industry pressure which is coming. Mind plays an extremely important role and we have forgotten our own capacity to heal ourselves. So that will have to be regained and this kind of work, integration has to be done which is evidence based, not just hearsay. But I can see that it is happening. Today also we saw several examples and institutions coming up with leadership of a person like Dr. Swaminathan. I am sure things will change for good. Thank you. I just wanted to differentiate between a holistic therapeutic trial versus a drug trial. When we are doing a drug trial, we are only taking one drug to test for its efficacy. But still it is possible because, imagine in traditional knowledge, every disease, there are at least 40-50 formulations available in one single test. And considering all different therapeutic tests, there may be hundreds of formulas. What does that mean? That means they have been specifically designed for specific conditions in a stage or severity or sub-type. And when you want to do a test of that, you will have to design your inclusion-exclusion criteria based on that and you should know what to expect from which drug's trial and Ayurveda's Phalashruti will actually guide from there. So even for a holistic therapeutic protocol, if you want to take up one drug to test, appropriate controls if taken and appropriate parameters if taken to evaluate. Because you cannot expect diabetes to get fully controlled and covered up by just one. Otherwise Charaka himself would not have given 150 formulations for it. Which means each formulation has a prescription time, a clinical end point to be moved on to the next kind of a medicine or next line of treatment. And in trials, one needs to take into account those details to be able to identify the outcomes or not. Again, multiple parameters, as I just gave an example of Prakriti. Prakriti is also determined by geoclimatic condition, ethnicity, familial characteristics, age, everything has been talked in Ayurveda also. That it is a multifactorial components which contribute to it. But if I want to test the Pratyadmanya, the one component as to inter-individual variability, I will have to keep everything else similar. Same genetic background, more or less same geoclimatic condition, same age group. I will take samples also at the same time of the day. And still if I see differences amongst healthy, then I can safely attribute it to. So that is how one will have to design controls and design parameters to appropriately question the efficacy. I think that is where we will be able to make a bridge. Thank you very much. I am going to address your question, whether it is really possible. And I said it is possible. But we need again two types of practitioners. He was introduced as physician, scientist. I am saying he is widely a scientist. And we have done this. Supriya is widely a scientist. So unless we have this kind of confluence of knowledge, it is not possible. It is a good message to end. We need another class of a widely a scientist so that we can put all this together and create a big one. Thank you very much sir. So now we are moving to our next discussion panel, which is a personalized arena for healthy aging, bridging the traditional knowledge and clinical practice. Our panelists are...",

                "chunk_index": 0,
                "text": "So, keeping that thing in our mind, you know, we have designed two panels. One is we are going to talk about, you know, discuss personalized Ayurveda for healthy aging, and how we can bridge the traditional knowledge with the clinical practice. And another is going to be a biohacking, biohacking aging, can Ayurveda and the modern find out the secret of longevity. I think these two panels, it's going to be a pretty good segue for what has been presented here. So, if you look at the aging, it's a very complex, multifaceted process influenced by our genetics, lifestyle, and environment. While, if you look at the modern medicine, it seeks to decode the longevity through technology, data. But if you look at the Ayurveda, it has provided a very personalized, holistic approach to aging for millennia. As you said, the yoga, how it's changing the gray matter, which is changing, you know, how it's being affected. But if you look at, you know, the principle behind those things, how they are interconnected, can we really put these together and use it to maintain the, you know, fidelity or prevent the age-related decline? So our first panel is going to just deliberate on this. And I want to start with, you know, inviting our esteemed panelist, Dr. M. Srikant, he's a Deputy Director in CCRS, which is funding a very active and proactive mode. And then, second panelist is Professor Rana Pisi, he's a professor in the School of… Okay, so we are starting with the second one. So we will start with the second one. So we will start with the biohacking, biohacking aging. Can Ayurveda and the modern science unlock the secret of longevity? So if I would like to invite our panelist, Dr. Kaustubh Upadhyay, he's an advisor in So, you know, my first question is with Dr. Kaustubh Upadhyay, if you look at the biohacking, which enhances the human performance and longevity through lifestyle modifications, diet and technology, Ayurveda with some limited, you know, time-tested practices like Utsayana, which we just saw, Vicharya and herbal therapy, has been optimizing our health for centuries. And especially in a context of fundamental of Ayurveda, like the Prakriti Agni and other things. Do you think, can Ayurvedic principles and methodology serve as a natural blueprint for achieving a healthy aging and longevity? If yes, then how we can merge both sciences together? In Ayurveda, we believe, what we know is very minute. What we don't know is a huge universe. So this we have to understand. That's why, while deducting Ayurveda, how Ayurveda, Brahma Svatpa, means the knowledge is there in the universe. We are just capturing. It's an observational science. So, if you want to find out each and every molecule and test it in various disorders or various problem areas, it's a Herculean job. So, how people, Ayurvedic people first got it? The principle says, Ayurveda, it's a nature selection. Nature tells you what is the Ayurveda. Ayurveda is Krishna. How it comes? Kurvate hi vichim dosa hai, parikra samanaya. Body system is like that. When something is disturbed in your body, body will demand. It will create a demand. That demand we have to recognize. So, our mental peace, if it is there, we will be able to appreciate it. Otherwise, we can't know what our stomach is asking, what our tongue is asking. So, if we are able to make that, differentiate, our body will tell what is medicine for us. So, most of the observations, even including proper observations, are done by the observation of animals. Animal, suppose you have a cat, you have a dog in the house, it gets disturbed. It will go and eat the grass and it will vomit out and it will get dizzy. Isn't it? It's in nature. So, for example, Shilajatu we are using since 4,000-5,000 years. One scientist who came here in India for some tourism issue, he observed some monkeys in certain range of Himalayas. They are very healthy. It is not same with the monkeys which are above that range and below that range. Then, he was keen and he start observed. And he saw that monkeys are going to cracks, rocks, spaces and scratch that surface and eating it. Then, they found what it is. It was Shilajatu what we are using in Ayurveda since ages. So, who has thought that monkey, that this has helped at the prolongation of age. So, these are all the knowledge systems which are there. This is a record. Whatever recorded in various traditional medicine sciences, it is a record observation that are documented. And that has been practiced. What we are practicing is not 2%. I believe people. And what modern science takes for research, it is fraction. 0.00001% of what we are following. So, we say what is the gap? Unless we entirely make a research with taking all the aspects together, we will not be able to contribute much to the science. We have almost past 75 years after independence. What is the original contribution to the medical science from India? Can we count in fingers? Not below 1 or 2. This is because we as a population, civilization, we were having original thinking from the days beginning. So, civilization starts from the questioning. Now, in our whatever education system, our thought process, we stop questioning everything. Without questioning, first question. So, that question should fit behind any bias. We say, we should not have any biases. That is the null hypothesis is the basis for any research. But we forget that. For every research protocol, we have a bias. So, that bias we bring and we will say we have null hypothesis. So, that bias we have to remove. Second. Tappa means you have to do hard work. Research takes lot of dedication and hard work. That you should commit. And if you put that, then nana will come automatically. Then you will come out with the research outputs which will be useful for the society. Bioprospecting in Ayurveda is the very useful tool. Without that, it will be like finding the needle in the sand. That is my observation, my opinion. Thank you. Thank you so much. That brings us to the next question. Because, you know, if you look at the biohacking, which is a modern way to enhance our, you know, reducing aging, enhancing longevity. And that's a concept of biohacking, if you think about it. If you look at that, it focuses more on the data-driven physiological optimization. Whereas, if you look at Ayurveda, it's a more holistic, system-based approach to well-being. How crucial it is, a question to Professor Bhushan Patwardhan, sir. How it's crucial to decipher the underlying biological mechanism of the Ayurvedic principles. Such as the metabolic regulation, or neuroplasticity, or immunomodulation. Which, if you look into the Ayurveda, talks about, you know, yoga, or agni, or, you know, oj, so on. This concept, to integrate the ancient wisdom with the modern biohacking movement. So that they both could mix and culminate in a better understanding. And take us to the, you know, start a new era. Thank you, Dr. Gopesh. And thank you for this question. Because I wanted to talk about this term, biohacking, itself. Because biohacking, to me, is oxymoron. And ethical biohacking is even more oxymoron. Because, and I saw one book, you know, on hacking health. And I say, what the heck?"

But if you look at the Ayurveda, which categorises a human extreme constituents, Prakrit type and then Agni, how do you think that where is the point where Tridosh and all these concepts can reconcile with, you know, biomatrix technology and create something which is new, more universal and more useful? So, I think, as you rightly said, we have a lot of tests and multiple things. As in the morning, you know, Gyan's talk was, you mentioned that we have many verticals of diagnostic parameters, positive factors, therapeutic options, we have very little interconnectedness. And I think that's where Ayurveda's interconnectedness, am I audible? So, that's where I think Ayurveda's Trisutra framework, which is essentially an interconnectedness between positive factors, clinical manifestations and corresponding therapeutic manifestations, therapeutic interventions, and that it is able to give because it connects with external environment and internal environment, with common language of Tridosha and that's very much a practical thing to do. Second thing is having analysed Tridosha in the clinical phenotypes, it also tells about the vulnerabilities and robustness, both patterns. It's called Khavegunya. Different Prakriti will have different susceptibilities based on their organ systems, strength and accordingly. So, that can help in identification of markers also. And accordingly, why we are worried about markers? Because then you can pinpointedly select the corresponding Dosha pacifying medicines to test on only those aspects rather than everything going everywhere and no dots getting connected. So, the example that I gave of the DNA type repair and the hypoxia and all, it tells that these are the things which are more predominantly observed in one Prakriti versus the other. So, corresponding Dosha pacifying medicines might actually have, and we have also proven with one of the herbs, Datura Vasika on hypoxia. Second thing is that when you are saying, so biohacking or maybe I can say that if people who are, in all our biology, we have metabolic processes going on, metabolic processes giving rise to something which is to be excreted out and or maybe cleared out of the system. So, we have all systems in place to clear out. If there is a system for genesis, there is a system for clearing out also. But when the second one is going down and other one, the production of waste or for that matter, even program said and if it goes beyond certain rates, the clearance is not happening and we are also seeing self-re-DNA like conditions in circulating blood which is causing a lot of inflammatory response. We have also got apoptosis to be matched with the atherocytosis to clear out all the things that have been thrown out in the system. Likewise, we also have biotoxins in our system. Ayurveda talks about Rasayan therapy, not just start giving good things one after the other and too many good things might not even actually eventually have the beneficial effects. It first talks about clearing out mechanism. So, something which is regularly happening is fine but if it is not happening, you provide it."

                "text": "So I think these are the concepts which will actually enable the integration of Vatik-Kaf based analysis plus Vatik-Kaf based or Shada selections to be able to take care of the aging process. Thank you, Ma'am. I think that brings me to the next question. You know, if you look at the way the modern, what they call it, biohacking, you know, so what they do, there's an emphasis on the, you know, different type of chemicals, including a caffeine, a monophenol, a synthetic peptide to enhance the brain function. Whereas if you look at, you know, the Ayurveda, it offers adoptogens, and I think, you know, in one presentation they showed how the adoptogen can enhance our brain functionality also. So how do you think that, you know, in terms of popularizing this, because you have the one which is getting a lot of popularity, the other one is, you know, we were talking about how we are going to integrate this, because there's always a question of long-term safety and efficacy with, you know, with natural medicine. So how, so how you think that that can be merged together? This may be a right question to a wrong person. Anyway, I would like to take a diversion, a little bit of diversion from the question. Don't think I'm dodging the question. You may ask this question to a right person. Probably, but I felt, I was there from the beginning listening to all the experts. One area that was not discussed was diet, aahar. Generally, Dr. Bhawana talks about Prakriti and aahar, but she did not mention that, maybe because of the paucity of time, and I'm sure even the audience doesn't want to speak about diet now, because after having such a delicious lunch and tea, the same, the same scenario prevails in research in the area of Ayurvedic aahar. Not much has been done. If you look at the literature, already available, they are generally a literature review, even in public, you see, or maybe some ingredients, food ingredients like garlic in dyslipidemia or the anti-inflammatory activity of turmeric, but food as a whole, as such a healthy diet is, what is healthy? One, healthy for me, may not be healthy for Dr. Bhawana. So, what is healthy for, so customized diet, so that's another area. Some people say, drink two liters of water, three liters of water, but somebody else says, no, that much of water is not good. Somebody says, hot water is good. No, I like cold water. I'm fine with cold water. I'm doing well, even after having cold water. Or we say in Ayurveda, cold is not good in general. So, buttermilk is better. So, what kind of study or evidence we have, that is one area where we need to focus a lot and in the area of food, there are several different aspects, like rasa. One particular rasa is vatakara or kafahara. So, then how to identify rasa? One that is sweet to me, may not be that sweet to others. So, there are several angles of that. Even the healthy food, milk, they say it's universally healthy, but it doesn't suit many people. So, this is what I feel. And one of the mandates of my institution, Central Ayurveda Research Institute, located in Bangalore. We are under the Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences, Ministry of Ayurveda of India. We are supposed to work in the area of dietetics. I see many young and intelligent people here. And any idea about research on dietetics in particular are welcome. We have a tie-up with CFTRI in Mysore, sir. In Ayurveda books, many formulations are mentioned too, but in what proportion they should be mixed or for how long they should be heated or boiled. So, that is not there. That's absent. So, to develop a formulation and also see their efficacy on animals. So, that's an effort we have initiated. That study is going on. We could develop 10 different formulations that were mentioned. In different dosage forms, we have developed ready-to-put kind of thing. So, this is just a general idea about what I wanted to express in this forum. Thank you. I am pleased to share diets with my parents and also my friend. Thank you. Taking further what she said about the differential suitability towards different dietary conditions. It also goes well for differential restrictive time eating. Because sometimes people say 2 meals a day is very good. Sometimes they say 6 meals. So, where do we reconcile all these things? Again, coming back to prakriti. People with prakriti cannot have 2 meals a day. Likewise, if calf prakriti is asked to eat every now and then, they will end up in metabolic dysregulation. So, I think there is nothing good for everyone. There has to be consideration of inter-individual variability. Especially in inter-metabolic patterns to be able to get the best benefits out of it. Even intermittent fasting may not suit everyone. However, good results there may be for intermittent fasting. So, very well said. One more information. FSSAI has published Ayurveda Aadhaar Guidelines in 2021. Anybody who is interested can go through and it says what are the… No, no, not… If you want to manufacture and sell any product in the name of Ayurveda, there are some regulations. Sir, can I ask a question? Yes, sure. The present trend in modern research is whatever non-molecules you want to correlate and keep great to that molecule, all they affect what we are ascribing to that particular drug as a whole. But each and every drug contains 50, 60, 100 types of phytomolecules. And we don't know which one is actually giving the result. So, before making, drawing conclusions without surveying everything, it is a disservice to the science. So, my request is while doing the integrated research where AYUSH component is involved, I want before finalizing the protocol, there should be a discussion regarding both the scientists should openly discuss various aspects and without taking the principles of Ayurveda and taking one particular drug will not serve. For example, in 50s and 60s, Reserpine is the only compound for BP, hypertension. But what happened after 20 years? But now, even today, Ayurvedic people are using Sarpagandha and they are giving results and no side effects whatever reported for Reserpine is coming in the Sarpagandha as a whole. So, these types of things are there. So, that reductionist approach should be carefully watched and making drawing conclusions. I have a reservation in conclusions drawn by most of the research works happening across the country. I have a very strong reservation on those conclusions because that bias, removing bias when you do that, those conclusions do not match with whatever work we have done. Because in biological research, control of environment is very challenging job. We are actually not able to control everything in biological world. So, lot of dependency will be there. Body will respond to each and every stimuli at every moment and body is exposed to so many other factors also. So, that control, what we say, is a misnomer in biological world. So, that we have to be careful in doing biomedical research. So, this brings to the end of the session. But with one question, I think I would like you all to answer that. Because if you look at what we call modern or conventional medicine which is going on right now, it is pretty much in a binary nature. You look at the diagnostics and then you try to correlate it. Sometimes there is no correlations. But if you look at Ayurveda, which is more holistic, more complex. So, what kind of a framework we can prepare which can accommodate both? First question is, is there a possibility that we can convert these two divergent pathways? And if we can do, what will be the framework and how we are going to achieve it? Possibility is always there. You have seen, I forgot the name. Hemant's presentation."

Protocols are fully designed in IISC research and that needs to be a serious attention of researchers from all across, from IISC, as well as partners. Thank you sir. It is possible and we have examples of those who are doing it successfully. The Neemak story we saw and I think when the physician-scientists like Dr. Srikanth are sitting here, they grow in number, this will automatically happen. Today a doctor was passed out from AIIMS, he is doing this kind of a treatment, no diabetes he is talking about, you know. Diabetes treatment, as a drug researcher I can tell you that if we dream that we will find out some magic bullet which will attack one target and one molecule and we will be able to control diabetes, impossible. It is absolutely not possible because it is a polygenic disease and we can't do that. But there are certain good things in allopathy as well. If you have to have quick fixes, you know, if you want immediate, if somebody is having chest pain or suspected any kind of a cardiac problem, we can't tell him to go to him and do yoga, you know, you have to go to a cardiologist and check. So this call will have to be taken and doctors will have to be more like guardians of health rather than only looking at public symptoms and quickly fixing them. And Ayurveda yoga, they can bring in solid support for non-pharmacological injuries. You spoke and we have been undermining this non-pharmacological part for quite some time and that is probably, not probably, mostly because of the industry pressure which is coming. Mind plays an extremely important role and we have forgotten our own capacity to heal ourselves. So that will have to be regained and this kind of work, integration has to be done which is evidence based, not just hearsay. But I can see that it is happening. Today also we saw several examples and institutions coming up with leadership of a person like Dr. Swaminathan. I am sure things will change for good. Thank you. I just wanted to differentiate between a holistic therapeutic trial versus a drug trial. When we are doing a drug trial, we are only taking one drug to test for its efficacy. But still it is possible because, imagine in traditional knowledge, every disease, there are at least 40-50 formulations available in one single test. And considering all different therapeutic tests, there may be hundreds of formulas. What does that mean? That means they have been specifically designed for specific conditions in a stage or severity or sub-type. And when you want to do a test of that, you will have to design your inclusion-exclusion criteria based on that and you should know what to expect from which drug's trial and Ayurveda's Phalashruti will actually guide from there. So even for a holistic therapeutic protocol, if you want to take up one drug to test, appropriate controls if taken and appropriate parameters if taken to evaluate. Because you cannot expect diabetes to get fully controlled and covered up by just one. Otherwise Charaka himself would not have given 150 formulations for it. Which means each formulation has a prescription time, a clinical end point to be moved on to the next kind of a medicine or next line of treatment. And in trials, one needs to take into account those details to be able to identify the outcomes or not. Again, multiple parameters, as I just gave an example of Prakriti. Prakriti is also determined by geoclimatic condition, ethnicity, familial characteristics, age, everything has been talked in Ayurveda also. That it is a multifactorial components which contribute to it. But if I want to test the Pratyadmanya, the one component as to inter-individual variability, I will have to keep everything else similar. Same genetic background, more or less same geoclimatic condition, same age group. I will take samples also at the same time of the day. And still if I see differences amongst healthy, then I can safely attribute it to. So that is how one will have to design controls and design parameters to appropriately question the efficacy. I think that is where we will be able to make a bridge. Thank you very much. I am going to address your question, whether it is really possible. And I said it is possible. But we need again two types of practitioners. He was introduced as physician, scientist. I am saying he is widely a scientist. And we have done this. Supriya is widely a scientist. So unless we have this kind of confluence of knowledge, it is not possible. It is a good message to end. We need another class of a widely a scientist so that we can put all this together and create a big one. Thank you very much sir. So now we are moving to our next discussion panel, which is a personalized arena for healthy aging, bridging the traditional knowledge and clinical practice. Our panelists are..."

        "summary": "Key Learnings and Insights:\n• Aging is a complex process influenced by genetics, lifestyle, and environment. Modern medicine and Ayurveda offer contrasting approaches, with the latter providing a personalized, holistic perspective for millennia.\n• Ayurveda is described as an observational science, drawing from nature's cues, emphasizing the interconnectedness of body and environment, and promoting a personalized approach to health and aging.\n• The concept of biohacking, focusing on technological and lifestyle modifications to enhance longevity, contrasts with Ayurveda's holistic, system-based approach. Integrating these could lead to a comprehensive understanding and application for healthy aging.\n• The importance of diet in Ayurveda highlights the need for personalized dietary recommendations based on individual constitution (Prakriti), underscoring the variability in health benefits and responses to different foods and practices.\n• The challenge in integrating Ayurvedic principles with modern science lies in the reductionist approach of the latter, often focusing on isolated compounds rather than the synergistic effects of whole treatments or practices.\n\nMain Discussion Points:\n• The panels discussed personalized Ayurveda for healthy aging and the potential integration of Ayurveda with modern biohacking techniques to unlock the secrets of longevity.\n• The holistic nature of Ayurveda, including the significance of diet (Ahara), daily routines (Dinacharya), and the balance of the three doshas, was emphasized as a foundation for health and well-being.\n• Concerns were raised about the modern trend of biohacking and its contrast to Ayurvedic principles, highlighting the importance of ethical, long-term, and holistic approaches to health optimization.\n• The role of dietetics in Ayurveda was discussed, including the customization of dietary practices based on individual needs and constitutions, and the potential for modern research to explore these areas further.\n\nAction Items and Applications:\n• Encourage interdisciplinary collaboration between Ayurvedic practitioners and modern scientists to explore integrative approaches to health and aging, focusing on evidence-based practices.\n• Develop and promote Ayurvedic dietary guidelines that consider individual variations in constitution and health needs, possibly through research partnerships with institutions like CFTRI.\n• Address the challenges of integrating Ayurvedic principles with modern healthcare by fostering a new class of physician-scientists who are well-versed in both paradigms.\n• Explore the potential for specific Ayurvedic practices, such as the use of adaptogens and personalized diet plans, to complement modern approaches to health optimization and longevity.\n\nRemember to:\n- Engage in open discussions and collaborations between Ayurvedic and modern scientific communities to bridge knowledge gaps.\n- Focus research efforts on understanding the mechanisms behind Ayurvedic practices and their applications in contemporary health contexts.\n- Promote education and awareness around the holistic, personalized nature of Ayurveda to both healthcare professionals and the public."

        "full_text": "I take complete onus of everything which goes on in these three days, but if everything goes right, there are a lot of people in the ground who have done fantastic work to make this meeting happen. If there's anybody who faces any issues, please feel free to speak to me, and I'll see what can be done. So now, coming to the technical talk, which I'm supposed to tell you about what my group has been doing. So my group is called Siamese Lab Analyze and Acquaintance, which is signaling aging, infection, and information. And this happened at this point with one of my students, and the idea was to capture what my lab does. I think it's a journey. There's not a lot of technical storytelling I'll be doing, but we're just getting a glimpse of what my lab has been doing for the last 15 years at Indian Institute of Science. And before that also, to give you an idea of how it actually led to the genesis of Longevity India, why, how, and why we landed with Longevity India in the first place. This is my journey. I started as a microbiologist. I started with bacterial communication. And once I started, I got hooked to communication. I wanted to see how cells communicate and decide, make decisions in anything which they do, whether it is pathogenicity, virulence, adaptation, survival, so basically looking for how communication works. After I finished my PhD with the Department of Communication, I went to a slightly higher level of communication to look at GPCR signaling, which is the receptors in our body, which talks to the environment and makes decisions for almost all physiological processes, like tendency, light, taste, pain, neuronal functions, dopamine, everything is linked to GPCR. And GPCR is also highly drug-able. People like to use GPCR to drug and cure various disorders. And that was what I did for a few years before I joined IISC. When I joined IISC, the question which we started asking was, the first question which we asked was, well, because our history of looking at communication, looking for GPCR, I want to look for a receptor, a GPCR molecule, which we can use to target agents. It's a very simplistic viewpoint. Is there a receptor in the agent cell which we can use to target cells and change the way agents are produced? And that's where we looked for a particular receptor. A very interesting receptor came into play, which we call a CXR. I'll talk about that a little later. But this started the aging research in my group. We were looking at very fundamental processes. Completely similar, looking at molecules, pathways, which we love to do. But that's what we are trained to do for all these science projects. Molecules and cells and systems. Which led us to look for molecules or genes, which will play an agent. And we started looking at enzymes in the genome, genes. And we started looking, removing them one at a time to understand how we can control aging. And that led us to mitochondria, which led us to looking at micro-oxide. And we started looking at the role of aging and infection. Then, as the journey progressed, we got interested in collaborative research. A lot of people have fantastic tools in the field of science. We started looking at three models of gene aging. And more recently, we've been interested in how cholesterol, a key molecule, which is called the bad molecule for a lot of healthcare practitioners, has actually formed a very interesting relationship with cholesterol. And our studies suggest that it's probably not a bad molecule. It's a good molecule. And the oxidized cholesterol is a bad molecule. And that journey, more recently, led to the emergence of conjugate. So coming out from the beginning of this story, when we study aging, the classical model system of aging says, you take a cell that damages DNA. And the DNA damage is going to undergo aging. Or we call it cellular cytosines. And people love doing that with various different approaches. We like to talk about shortening of genome arrays, oxidative squares, genotoxic squares, activate a cancer on the gene. And we can do this. And this accumulates in the body. We can ensure that we are successful for aging. And you ask me, this is the question. You started the question last week. All these ways by which we can trigger aging, are they actually interlinked to a simple process, which is the DNA damage? Now, can a gene gain a damage from reactive oxidases? That was the first question. Because reactive oxidase is considered the main culprit behind aging. It's a reactive oxidase species which damages DNA. What we did was we actually took an analog of a molecule, which is found in DNA and a gene analog, which is bromo-neuroscopic. And further, people who are non-scientific, like us, would like to look into details of molecules. This molecule goes into DNA, fits into the DNA. But DNA machinery, which replicates DNA, does not like this molecule, because it's not the true sex of the molecule which makes the DNA. It's an invader. So it triggers a process which we call DNA damage response. It asks the cells, I don't think this is the right DNA. We need to stop replication and trigger damage response. What happens is that we can quantify this damage response. This is a damaged cell. And you can see all these interesting lesions or foci. And you can count them and quantitate them. And this is a normal cell. As you can see, this cell, which is treated with this agent, shows numerous small foci or damaged lesions. And these damaged cells actually enter the agent. Now, in a cellular perspective, a damaged agent cell has a very interesting fate. It sits in your lab without dying, without dividing. It's like the old people who sit under the tree in the ancient system who have to just sit there for years all together. Sometimes you laugh and you say, you know, I don't see these guys doing anything. They just sit there and pass comments to everybody who passes by. And that's what exactly the agent cell is. It just sits there, does not divide, does not die. It just keeps generating this inflammatory milieu or inflammatory cytokine, which starts triggering systemic aging. And when we use the system, we could actually find that the system mimics almost all the features of aging cells, which includes arrest of cell death, changing in the extracellular milieu, inflammatory cytokine, and loss of cell proliferation. And using this model, we ended up proving something very interesting, that reactive oxygen species does not necessarily have to trigger aging. It plays a role in maintenance of cells and stage keeping cells alive without killing them. But the cells can become aged if the DNA is damaged independent of reactive oxygen species also. However, in our system, in metabolic problems we face, reactive oxygen species happens to be the main molecule which damages our DNA and causes an advancement of age. So by looking at this aging cell, we are interested in the model system. We were asking questions, does this model system help me reach my receptor, which I want to target? So we did find one receptor, and we did a large scale analysis of genes, which are changed, or proteins, which are changed. And we found one receptor, which is increased in aging cells. And this receptor, which we call the CXCR4, it's a cytokine with a 3.9 receptor. Interesting molecule, expressed in a 3 known cellular body. And what we found in this receptor is presented with a higher copy number than almost all aging model systems we've used. Some of them are our favorite lab models, some of them are primary cells, young membranes. In every system what we found, this receptor was in higher copy number. And this receptor, what we end up doing to a long, long experiment, which took five years of PhD students, earlier, proved that this receptor increases inflammatory responses in the cells. And this is a model which we came up with. In our body, we have all the cells which are young. Some cells undergo damage and become old. And these are the old cells. And when these cells become old, the receptor which is the CXCR4 receptor, it presents a high copy number of the cell, which increases their sensitivity to the ligand, because the copy number is more, and it starts generating inflammatory cytokine locally around this damaged cell, so immune cells can move and clear this damaged cell. So that's what happens in our body all the time when we're young. Damaged cells are generated, our immune system comes in clear. But what happens when there are too many damaged cells? That's what happens when we start getting old, because there are too many points of weird machine disease. It's like a super-dirty place and a few clean machines. This leads to accumulation of damaged cells in the body, which leads to sensitivity. So we found the receptor to be very interesting in terms of creating, through the process of using information. So while we were making this model, we had fantastic data. We saw the receptor is on, information is on. We were recruiting new cells. But by mistake, one of my students actually forgot to keep the cells back in the freezer, and she left the cells in an incubator for many days. And what we found, that after some days, this receptor does not respond to information. It actually stopped triggering immune responses. It actually stopped changes in behavior completely. Now, we were intrigued. We were intrigued for a very long time. For such a long time, we actually put this experiment also into the research. We said, OK, this is something very bizarre happening. We really do not know why a receptor suddenly changed from an inflammatory-inducing receptor to an inflammation-inhibiting receptor, which is in the late stage of sepsis. Now, this raised very, very interesting problems for us. And we kept sitting on it for a very long time, till my student in the lab joined Surabaya, who actually said, let's look at if something is wrong in this part. And I'm sure all of you have interacted with Surabaya. She brings food and milk to everybody out here. And that's what she does not do in real life here. She's actually a scientist. trying to do some sense of this receptor. So she looked at, if the receptor is intact, it was yes. If the receptor was triggering signaling changes, it was fine. And then we asked the question, what exactly is wrong with this receptor? This is a movie. I hope this movie plays for this. It does not play. So this is all explained. So you can see these Christmas lights. They look like Christmas lights. They're divided by a lot. This is the normal cell. And when we activate this receptor, these fireballs, or these calcium oscillations come inside the cell. And they keep coming, because that's what receptors do. They trigger calcium release, and they reabsorb calcium. And every detail, these fireballs keep happening. But in the agent cell, we do not see these fireballs. And if you probe this fireball, you can see these profiles. And these are the profiles of the agents. And we found that the receptor was not able to trigger the signaling adversities. And after a lot of thought process, we said, this receptor loves cholesterol. It wants cholesterol to stay in the membrane. It wants cholesterol to stay active. Let's look at the cholesterol molecule. And our assumption was very simplistic. That if the agent cell has high oxidative stress, the cholesterol is actually going to undergo oxidation and form this notorious molecule called oxytocin. Now, oxytocin, everybody knows that it's actually a bad molecule. But we wanted to prove that this is the bad molecule for aging cholesterol. And what we did with this hypothesis that increased reactive oxygen species converts our favorite molecule, cholesterol, to oxysterol, which is the bad cholesterol, we actually did a quantifying in the agent cell. And what we found in the agent cell, cholesterol is low and oxidized cholesterol is high. And these are all different types of oxidized cholesterol. Cholesterol is a high molecule. There's a tail. There's an egg. And oxidation can affect multiple things. And what we found was almost all the bases, oxidized cholesterol is going high. But that doesn't prove anything. It shows the cholesterol is oxidized, which is expected. It still does not link to what CACR is showing. What we did, we took young cells. And we threw oxidized cholesterol into these cells. We did not wait for them to get old. We just threw it. And we asked, does that affect my calcium signaling? And the answer is yes. Oxidized cholesterol actually impairs or knocks out calcium signaling. So now we have an interesting hypothesis. Just the presence of oxysterol is sufficient to change the way receptors on the membrane of a cell work. And this is a big hypothesis picture. This is normal cholesterol, oxidized cholesterol. This is what a normal receptor in a cell is doing, enhancing inflammation in the agent cell example. Now, if you think this carefully, this observation tells us something very fascinating. These here are drugs. Basically, all the known drugs, most of the drugs, right from histamine receptors, to anthropomics, to dopamine, to serotonin, we actually use them as drug targets. And we think from this observation, we find that many of the drugs do not work that effectively in aging people. What if this is the case? What if we have been looking at probability of receptors in the young population? Because that's what we do. When we look for drugs, train for drugs, we do trials in young people. We actually exclude old people from trial because they give a heterogeneous data. This is a reason for heterogeneity. Is this the way we can actually address the requirement of drugs and drug ability in aging population? But we're saying that we really need to re-look at receptors which need to be drugged in aging population. Because if this kind of switch is happening, we are actually either under-drugging them or over-drugging them. Or we're probably triggering some pathologies which need not be there in the first place. So this is what we have been doing with GPCR. I'll switch it quickly. There's some screen which we did. We knocked on a whole bunch of genes in our cell system to see which gene, when you remove, can switch on aging without actually any damage from outside. And one of the genes which we formed was here, a PIM-15. It is a phosphatase in which it removes phosphate from proteins. But this is actually a mitochondrial protein. And what we found in normal aging, this protein expression comes down. And a lot of studies, again, I was doing this study, and a lot of studies actually revealed that when you actually stabilize this protein, which is actually one protein which brings our favorite anti-aging molecules to twin, to PIM-15, we showed that circuit actually regulates expression of PIM-15. And when PIM-15 is stabilized, the cells actually do not end up in association. And we also found a small molecule stabilizer for this PIM-15. Now, if you give this small molecule stabilizer and you insert the cell by reactive oxygen species or any other agent for aging, they do not enter aging. Or they slow down significantly. So this is one of our attempts to use monoclonal inhibitors to address aging and age-associated pathologies. Now, this is where we venture into trying to understand that if this is indeed true that mitochondria is a key driver for aging, what if I damage just the mitochondria? I leave my nucleolus out of the picture. So one of my students, Abraham, this is still unpublished. He actually developed a model by damaging the mitochondria selectively by really low-dose radiation treatment. And he showed that if you can stop mitochondrial injury, prevent mitochondrial loss generation, the nuclear DNA does not get damaged, and it prevents it. So this comes full circle to a lot of popular theory of aging, which is mitochondria is a key culprit in aging. It's a mitochondria whose dysfunction triggers aging. And we have very interesting evidence to show that, indeed, mitochondria could be a major driver of aging. Now, this leads me to a lot of collaborative studies which are going on with various faculty in the Institute of Science. We've been looking at, it's a large group, that if, in the age triangle, we trigger an infectious agent, here we use salmonella and tuberculosis, do they actually succumb as a classical thought process? What we found was the reverse. We actually found the aging animal or aging cell system through using a resistant cell. The bacterial burden was lower in the aging. And that was primarily because they had high nitric oxide, which is a key antibacterial, antimicrobial agent. When you block this nitric oxide, naturally the infection goes up. Interestingly, we found that even though the burden is low, the actual effect, basically mortality, was not lower because the aging animal people died because of unresolved inflammation rather than a bacterial burden. We also developed cellular systems, which is a pre-cultured systems. We developed a biomechanical phospho-phosphate depredative group, which we used to study aging. And we found the aging, which we use in lab in two dimensions, can be an exaggerated response. And what we can gain in theory is actually a suppressed inflammatory response, similar to what we see in our body. We also developed some biometric reagent, in which we have introduced HSI cilia, which quench reactive oxygen species. And that's why we think this material is more useful for aging. This is where we are right now. We're looking at a lot of different aspects of the aging cell method. We're looking at DNA damage, proteostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction, biomolecule oxidation, and biochemical and drug screening. While this is happening, a lot of collaboration was happening. We realized, probably, looking at cellular systems, just cells and model systems are not sufficient. We must take a leap of faith and transition to the human studies. And that's where we actually thought we'd transition to a multi-disciplinary investigation and move on to the human studies. And that led to the formation of the longevity area. This is the global landscape. A lot of interesting work done globally. We have David here from Buff Institute. We have other speakers who have been here representing the global community of longevity research. And we established Longevity India. So I think a quick journey about longevity India, how it came into being, and what was the genesis. It was on August 23. A lot of us, people from various disciplines, people in biological sciences, engineers, data guys, come together. And we started thinking, can we use our strength of various different disciplines, which we are trained to, to actually look at problem creation. Because it needs, as a lot of people said, a multi-disciplinary, multi-view point. And using that, we actually projected this idea to Mr. Prashant Prakash, who was generous enough to give us the seed funding, which led to a new creation of this project as longevity India. In April 2024, we launched Longevity India Initiative. And 2024, August, we had the first industry conference. A lot of people here in the audience were part of that deliberation. It was an interesting presentation where we did not give too many academicians a platform to talk about even though it was an ISE. A lot of industry people, they wanted to hear how industry views longevity. How do they see things are done in an industry setting? Because a lot of true and not so true things which are happening in the industry addressing longevity or aging research. And in 2024, we launched Violet Study. Violet Study is an acronym. I will come to that a little later. This study aims to look at healthy aging in India or a multi-parametric view point. We have got multiple studies going on in India where people are looking at gene relationship with aging. We have this study where we talk about Indian genome atlas. We have also a study which has been done by Avastha and Avastha Genome, which actually talked about looking at genomic of Indian and Parsi populations to see if we can find some correlates. But what we are trying to do is collect a lot of multi-parametric data. And then we have recently got ICMR-CAR and here we are at Enterprise. This is what Longevity India aims to do. We are actually trying to bridge science, medicine, technology and society. to develop a hub in which everybody can relate and try to address next-generation problems. This is a team. I'm not going to read the names. They're all in the audience. Find them here and talk to them. What's the sense of the team? They're all specialists in one part, one part of the human body, one data science, one microbiome expert, biomaterial guys. What we did was to put everybody together so that everybody can lend their strengths to address one common problem, which is aging and longevity. Please speak and talk to the colleagues who are in the audience. And this is what Bharat Study is all about. Bharat Study is an acronym as I mentioned. It is biomarkers for every aging, resilience, adversity, and transition. If you look at this acronym, it's pretty much summarizing what changes happens in our body during our lifetime. In this term, we are sampling healthy Indian population, rural, urban. We reach out to some materials. We collect a lot of data, almost 2 million data points, which includes functional changes, cognitive, metabolic changes from serum proteins, serum metabolites, epigenetics, gut biome, biophysical changes in the blood cells, immune profile, and a lot more data is collected so we can make a portrait of a healthy Indian so that we can understand what the trajectory is of aging. What Longevity India wants to do is I'll not go through this slide in detail, but our idea is that in the long run we can imagine, investigate, innovate, and implement various aspects of aging using stakeholders which are scientists, industry people, clinicians, and investors. We can develop a completely new ecosystem when we talk about aging in today's science. And this is our long-term vision. This is the longevity vision. What we have shown here in this slide is what we have strengthened. We want to refine India's specific standards of health, our standard. Nutrition, screening technology, drug development, novel therapeutic targets, biomarker discovery, and cellular models. And this is our vision, that this is where we are going to have a societal impact. Reduce hospitalization, dignity in aging, preventive health, improve quality of life, and societal innovation. For a country like this, a country in India which is so huge, a crowded hospital is not a good site. To have a good understanding of a country's healthcare, you write a NGO. But people only go when there is an absolute need to talk about sick care. We should not go to a hospital for a health care. Healthcare is something you should understand better so that we can avoid people from reaching hospitals where they are. And I'll stop here. And this initiative is supported by the science as it is. And I'm right now with the ICMR support. To continue with initiatives, my lab has been funded by ICMR, DFT. Raju Kheer has also received fellowship support from Kiran Mazumdar-Shah. Donations and CSR support. These are lots of collaborations. This is an integral part of modern science. We can choose to do everything in our labs. But we really need collaborators from industry to make this vision happen. A lot of these companies are giving support to us, giving us access to technology on a variety basis, access to technology at low cost, access to platforms which are still not public so that we can actually develop this longevity data set. And we are looking for support. Support is very critical for initiatives like this. No matter how much funding support we get, for each individual we spend about two lakh rupees to collect data, we really need a lot of support to keep it going. And to prevent it from derailing, we are looking for support in various areas. We are looking for people who have data collection, fellowships, volunteers. Every healthy person is a potential volunteer for us. For collecting health data, collaborative research projects, internship, donation, and we are very happy to support ICMR. I'll stop here. And I'll be open to questions. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. I have no questions. I was very convincing when I introduced you. All right. Thank you. Yes. Excellent presentation. We are collecting data in the card study and different dimensions. Is there any way you are doing phenotypic stratification as well to look at the different groups and how they play on those parameters? Yes. We are collecting a huge amount of metadata. So a lot of phenotypic data which includes their life, lifestyle, their privacy, their family, their habits, everything. There's almost 25 pages of metadata which we collect. It's a lot of data. I think one of the ways by which I can contribute is phenotypic stratification of healthy individuals and whether you see. And there are many other parameters also by which you can stratify individuals to look for underlying molecular disease. We'd love to talk to you about it. As I said, this is a hot topic. A lot of people suggest how we can improve our data collection. I'm very intrigued in finding that cholesterol gets oxidized during aging. Have you looked at how it's affecting the overall validity of the membrane and how it's affecting the graft formation and then overall general signaling transduction which might happen from the membrane to the nucleus? How its dynamics is changing? That's the question. I don't know how. Because you need to listen to surrounding structures when you get all the details. But what changes in a cell when you get it to a complex structure? That's the question. You know that's a lot of data. And I would not steal that data from you. Well, my question was an extension of what Mukesh has asked. First of all, excellent presentation. There are situations where excessive inflammatory response is a problem. And oxidized cholesterol, are they already used as some kind of a remediation? Yes. Actually, oxidized cholesterol needs to go up in a lot of cases like neurodegenerative disorders. Who sees oxidized cholesterol? How do you get so many good responses? And to figure out which one goes up in which system, that requires some high resolution aspect of information. That is something we're in the process of developing. Yes. Question. Question. Question. Question. Question. Question. Question. Question. Question. Question. Question. Question. Question. Question. Question. Question. Question. Question. Question. Question. Question. Question. Question. Question. Question. Question. Question. Question. Question. Question. Question. Question. Question. Question. but then it becomes maladaptive, right? That's why I say it's necessary. So I think the problem is we only measure cholesterol. We do not have means to measure cholesterol and accessorize it. So that debate will stand unresolved when we figure out that. Once we do that, I think we'll get a lot of insights into cholesterol. There's a very old paper in 1940, which said cholesterol is not accessorized. So maybe perhaps that was the right decision. I'll stop here. Thank you.",

                "text": "I take complete onus of everything which goes on in these three days, but if everything goes right, there are a lot of people in the ground who have done fantastic work to make this meeting happen. If there's anybody who faces any issues, please feel free to speak to me, and I'll see what can be done. So now, coming to the technical talk, which I'm supposed to tell you about what my group has been doing. So my group is called Siamese Lab Analyze and Acquaintance, which is signaling aging, infection, and information. And this happened at this point with one of my students, and the idea was to capture what my lab does. I think it's a journey. There's not a lot of technical storytelling I'll be doing, but we're just getting a glimpse of what my lab has been doing for the last 15 years at Indian Institute of Science. And before that also, to give you an idea of how it actually led to the genesis of Longevity India, why, how, and why we landed with Longevity India in the first place. This is my journey. I started as a microbiologist. I started with bacterial communication. And once I started, I got hooked to communication. I wanted to see how cells communicate and decide, make decisions in anything which they do, whether it is pathogenicity, virulence, adaptation, survival, so basically looking for how communication works. After I finished my PhD with the Department of Communication, I went to a slightly higher level of communication to look at GPCR signaling, which is the receptors in our body, which talks to the environment and makes decisions for almost all physiological processes, like tendency, light, taste, pain, neuronal functions, dopamine, everything is linked to GPCR. And GPCR is also highly drug-able. People like to use GPCR to drug and cure various disorders. And that was what I did for a few years before I joined IISC. When I joined IISC, the question which we started asking was, the first question which we asked was, well, because our history of looking at communication, looking for GPCR, I want to look for a receptor, a GPCR molecule, which we can use to target agents. It's a very simplistic viewpoint. Is there a receptor in the agent cell which we can use to target cells and change the way agents are produced? And that's where we looked for a particular receptor. A very interesting receptor came into play, which we call a CXR. I'll talk about that a little later. But this started the aging research in my group. We were looking at very fundamental processes. Completely similar, looking at molecules, pathways, which we love to do. But that's what we are trained to do for all these science projects. Molecules and cells and systems. Which led us to look for molecules or genes, which will play an agent. And we started looking at enzymes in the genome, genes. And we started looking, removing them one at a time to understand how we can control aging. And that led us to mitochondria, which led us to looking at micro-oxide. And we started looking at the role of aging and infection. Then, as the journey progressed, we got interested in collaborative research. A lot of people have fantastic tools in the field of science. We started looking at three models of gene aging. And more recently, we've been interested in how cholesterol, a key molecule, which is called the bad molecule for a lot of healthcare practitioners, has actually formed a very interesting relationship with cholesterol. And our studies suggest that it's probably not a bad molecule. It's a good molecule. And the oxidized cholesterol is a bad molecule. And that journey, more recently, led to the emergence of conjugate. So coming out from the beginning of this story, when we study aging, the classical model system of aging says, you take a cell that damages DNA. And the DNA damage is going to undergo aging. Or we call it cellular cytosines. And people love doing that with various different approaches. We like to talk about shortening of genome arrays, oxidative squares, genotoxic squares, activate a cancer on the gene. And we can do this. And this accumulates in the body. We can ensure that we are successful for aging. And you ask me, this is the question. You started the question last week. All these ways by which we can trigger aging, are they actually interlinked to a simple process, which is the DNA damage? Now, can a gene gain a damage from reactive oxidases? That was the first question. Because reactive oxidase is considered the main culprit behind aging. It's a reactive oxidase species which damages DNA. What we did was we actually took an analog of a molecule, which is found in DNA and a gene analog, which is bromo-neuroscopic. And further, people who are non-scientific, like us, would like to look into details of molecules. This molecule goes into DNA, fits into the DNA. But DNA machinery, which replicates DNA, does not like this molecule, because it's not the true sex of the molecule which makes the DNA. It's an invader. So it triggers a process which we call DNA damage response. It asks the cells, I don't think this is the right DNA. We need to stop replication and trigger damage response. What happens is that we can quantify this damage response. This is a damaged cell. And you can see all these interesting lesions or foci. And you can count them and quantitate them. And this is a normal cell. As you can see, this cell, which is treated with this agent, shows numerous small foci or damaged lesions. And these damaged cells actually enter the agent. Now, in a cellular perspective, a damaged agent cell has a very interesting fate. It sits in your lab without dying, without dividing. It's like the old people who sit under the tree in the ancient system who have to just sit there for years all together. Sometimes you laugh and you say, you know, I don't see these guys doing anything. They just sit there and pass comments to everybody who passes by. And that's what exactly the agent cell is. It just sits there, does not divide, does not die. It just keeps generating this inflammatory milieu or inflammatory cytokine, which starts triggering systemic aging. And when we use the system, we could actually find that the system mimics almost all the features of aging cells, which includes arrest of cell death, changing in the extracellular milieu, inflammatory cytokine, and loss of cell proliferation. And using this model, we ended up proving something very interesting, that reactive oxygen species does not necessarily have to trigger aging. It plays a role in maintenance of cells and stage keeping cells alive without killing them. But the cells can become aged if the DNA is damaged independent of reactive oxygen species also. However, in our system, in metabolic problems we face, reactive oxygen species happens to be the main molecule which damages our DNA and causes an advancement of age. So by looking at this aging cell, we are interested in the model system. We were asking questions, does this model system help me reach my receptor, which I want to target? So we did find one receptor, and we did a large scale analysis of genes, which are changed, or proteins, which are changed. And we found one receptor, which is increased in aging cells. And this receptor, which we call the CXCR4, it's a cytokine with a 3.9 receptor. Interesting molecule, expressed in a 3 known cellular body. And what we found in this receptor is presented with a higher copy number than almost all aging model systems we've used. Some of them are our favorite lab models, some of them are primary cells, young membranes. In every system what we found, this receptor was in higher copy number. And this receptor, what we end up doing to a long, long experiment, which took five years of PhD students, earlier, proved that this receptor increases inflammatory responses in the cells. And this is a model which we came up with. In our body, we have all the cells which are young. Some cells undergo damage and become old. And these are the old cells. And when these cells become old, the receptor which is the CXCR4 receptor, it presents a high copy number of the cell, which increases their sensitivity to the ligand, because the copy number is more, and it starts generating inflammatory cytokine locally around this damaged cell, so immune cells can move and clear this damaged cell. So that's what happens in our body all the time when we're young. Damaged cells are generated, our immune system comes in clear. But what happens when there are too many damaged cells? That's what happens when we start getting old, because there are too many points of weird machine disease. It's like a super-dirty place and a few clean machines. This leads to accumulation of damaged cells in the body, which leads to sensitivity. So we found the receptor to be very interesting in terms of creating, through the process of using information. So while we were making this model, we had fantastic data. We saw the receptor is on, information is on. We were recruiting new cells. But by mistake, one of my students actually forgot to keep the cells back in the freezer, and she left the cells in an incubator for many days. And what we found, that after some days, this receptor does not respond to information. It actually stopped triggering immune responses. It actually stopped changes in behavior completely. Now, we were intrigued. We were intrigued for a very long time. For such a long time, we actually put this experiment also into the research. We said, OK, this is something very bizarre happening. We really do not know why a receptor suddenly changed from an inflammatory-inducing receptor to an inflammation-inhibiting receptor, which is in the late stage of sepsis. Now, this raised very, very interesting problems for us. And we kept sitting on it for a very long time, till my student in the lab joined Surabaya, who actually said, let's look at if something is wrong in this part. And I'm sure all of you have interacted with Surabaya. She brings food and milk to everybody out here. And that's what she does not do in real life here. She's actually a scientist."

                "text": "trying to do some sense of this receptor. So she looked at, if the receptor is intact, it was yes. If the receptor was triggering signaling changes, it was fine. And then we asked the question, what exactly is wrong with this receptor? This is a movie. I hope this movie plays for this. It does not play. So this is all explained. So you can see these Christmas lights. They look like Christmas lights. They're divided by a lot. This is the normal cell. And when we activate this receptor, these fireballs, or these calcium oscillations come inside the cell. And they keep coming, because that's what receptors do. They trigger calcium release, and they reabsorb calcium. And every detail, these fireballs keep happening. But in the agent cell, we do not see these fireballs. And if you probe this fireball, you can see these profiles. And these are the profiles of the agents. And we found that the receptor was not able to trigger the signaling adversities. And after a lot of thought process, we said, this receptor loves cholesterol. It wants cholesterol to stay in the membrane. It wants cholesterol to stay active. Let's look at the cholesterol molecule. And our assumption was very simplistic. That if the agent cell has high oxidative stress, the cholesterol is actually going to undergo oxidation and form this notorious molecule called oxytocin. Now, oxytocin, everybody knows that it's actually a bad molecule. But we wanted to prove that this is the bad molecule for aging cholesterol. And what we did with this hypothesis that increased reactive oxygen species converts our favorite molecule, cholesterol, to oxysterol, which is the bad cholesterol, we actually did a quantifying in the agent cell. And what we found in the agent cell, cholesterol is low and oxidized cholesterol is high. And these are all different types of oxidized cholesterol. Cholesterol is a high molecule. There's a tail. There's an egg. And oxidation can affect multiple things. And what we found was almost all the bases, oxidized cholesterol is going high. But that doesn't prove anything. It shows the cholesterol is oxidized, which is expected. It still does not link to what CACR is showing. What we did, we took young cells. And we threw oxidized cholesterol into these cells. We did not wait for them to get old. We just threw it. And we asked, does that affect my calcium signaling? And the answer is yes. Oxidized cholesterol actually impairs or knocks out calcium signaling. So now we have an interesting hypothesis. Just the presence of oxysterol is sufficient to change the way receptors on the membrane of a cell work. And this is a big hypothesis picture. This is normal cholesterol, oxidized cholesterol. This is what a normal receptor in a cell is doing, enhancing inflammation in the agent cell example. Now, if you think this carefully, this observation tells us something very fascinating. These here are drugs. Basically, all the known drugs, most of the drugs, right from histamine receptors, to anthropomics, to dopamine, to serotonin, we actually use them as drug targets. And we think from this observation, we find that many of the drugs do not work that effectively in aging people. What if this is the case? What if we have been looking at probability of receptors in the young population? Because that's what we do. When we look for drugs, train for drugs, we do trials in young people. We actually exclude old people from trial because they give a heterogeneous data. This is a reason for heterogeneity. Is this the way we can actually address the requirement of drugs and drug ability in aging population? But we're saying that we really need to re-look at receptors which need to be drugged in aging population. Because if this kind of switch is happening, we are actually either under-drugging them or over-drugging them. Or we're probably triggering some pathologies which need not be there in the first place. So this is what we have been doing with GPCR. I'll switch it quickly. There's some screen which we did. We knocked on a whole bunch of genes in our cell system to see which gene, when you remove, can switch on aging without actually any damage from outside. And one of the genes which we formed was here, a PIM-15. It is a phosphatase in which it removes phosphate from proteins. But this is actually a mitochondrial protein. And what we found in normal aging, this protein expression comes down. And a lot of studies, again, I was doing this study, and a lot of studies actually revealed that when you actually stabilize this protein, which is actually one protein which brings our favorite anti-aging molecules to twin, to PIM-15, we showed that circuit actually regulates expression of PIM-15. And when PIM-15 is stabilized, the cells actually do not end up in association. And we also found a small molecule stabilizer for this PIM-15. Now, if you give this small molecule stabilizer and you insert the cell by reactive oxygen species or any other agent for aging, they do not enter aging. Or they slow down significantly. So this is one of our attempts to use monoclonal inhibitors to address aging and age-associated pathologies. Now, this is where we venture into trying to understand that if this is indeed true that mitochondria is a key driver for aging, what if I damage just the mitochondria? I leave my nucleolus out of the picture. So one of my students, Abraham, this is still unpublished. He actually developed a model by damaging the mitochondria selectively by really low-dose radiation treatment. And he showed that if you can stop mitochondrial injury, prevent mitochondrial loss generation, the nuclear DNA does not get damaged, and it prevents it. So this comes full circle to a lot of popular theory of aging, which is mitochondria is a key culprit in aging. It's a mitochondria whose dysfunction triggers aging. And we have very interesting evidence to show that, indeed, mitochondria could be a major driver of aging. Now, this leads me to a lot of collaborative studies which are going on with various faculty in the Institute of Science. We've been looking at, it's a large group, that if, in the age triangle, we trigger an infectious agent, here we use salmonella and tuberculosis, do they actually succumb as a classical thought process? What we found was the reverse. We actually found the aging animal or aging cell system through using a resistant cell. The bacterial burden was lower in the aging. And that was primarily because they had high nitric oxide, which is a key antibacterial, antimicrobial agent. When you block this nitric oxide, naturally the infection goes up. Interestingly, we found that even though the burden is low, the actual effect, basically mortality, was not lower because the aging animal people died because of unresolved inflammation rather than a bacterial burden. We also developed cellular systems, which is a pre-cultured systems. We developed a biomechanical phospho-phosphate depredative group, which we used to study aging.

And I'll be open to questions. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. I have no questions. I was very convincing when I introduced you. All right. Thank you. Yes. Excellent presentation. We are collecting data in the card study and different dimensions. Is there any way you are doing phenotypic stratification as well to look at the different groups and how they play on those parameters? Yes. We are collecting a huge amount of metadata. So a lot of phenotypic data which includes their life, lifestyle, their privacy, their family, their habits, everything. There's almost 25 pages of metadata which we collect. It's a lot of data. I think one of the ways by which I can contribute is phenotypic stratification of healthy individuals and whether you see. And there are many other parameters also by which you can stratify individuals to look for underlying molecular disease. We'd love to talk to you about it. As I said, this is a hot topic. A lot of people suggest how we can improve our data collection. I'm very intrigued in finding that cholesterol gets oxidized during aging. Have you looked at how it's affecting the overall validity of the membrane and how it's affecting the graft formation and then overall general signaling transduction which might happen from the membrane to the nucleus? How its dynamics is changing? That's the question. I don't know how. Because you need to listen to surrounding structures when you get all the details. But what changes in a cell when you get it to a complex structure? That's the question. You know that's a lot of data. And I would not steal that data from you. Well, my question was an extension of what Mukesh has asked. First of all, excellent presentation. There are situations where excessive inflammatory response is a problem. And oxidized cholesterol, are they already used as some kind of a remediation? Yes. Actually, oxidized cholesterol needs to go up in a lot of cases like neurodegenerative disorders. Who sees oxidized cholesterol? How do you get so many good responses? And to figure out which one goes up in which system, that requires some high resolution aspect of information. That is something we're in the process of developing. Yes. Question. Question. Question. Question. Question. Question. Question. Question. Question. Question. Question. Question. Question. Question. Question. Question. Question. Question. Question. Question. Question. Question. Question. Question. Question. Question. Question. Question. Question. Question. Question. Question. Question.

                "text": "but then it becomes maladaptive, right? That's why I say it's necessary. So I think the problem is we only measure cholesterol. We do not have means to measure cholesterol and accessorize it. So that debate will stand unresolved when we figure out that. Once we do that, I think we'll get a lot of insights into cholesterol. There's a very old paper in 1940, which said cholesterol is not accessorized. So maybe perhaps that was the right decision. I'll stop here. Thank you."

This is Brahmi, Bacopa, treated with Bacopa where you can see the amyloid being gone and then they treated with Mandukaparni. This is after 7 days and this one is after 14 days. This is after 14 days and after 7 days we have seen that in the experimental models, in rat models we have seen the amyloid being completely eliminated by Brahmi and Mandukaparni. Brahmi and Mandukaparni are the most studied drugs in such conditions currently. Now we have finished, this article has been accepted. Now this is the 6th case report of patients with negative symptoms who have responded excellently well with Ayurveda and Yoga therapies. This is another research, ambitious research study funded by Ministry of Ayush. Here we have taken, the aim of this study is to provide comprehensive evidence, neurobiological correlates to neuropsychiatric disorders. In terms of 4, we have taken 2, Schizophrenia and Alzheimer's dementia, Schizophrenia and mood disorders in terms of psychiatry, Alzheimer's dementia and multiple sclerosis in terms of neurology. The 4 pillars of investigation that we have undertaken are Genomics, Neuroimaging and Microbiome and Immune. The study goals are to look at mechanistic aspects of how the Ayurveda based therapies or Ayurveda and Yoga based integrative therapies, how they act. It's like, you know, there is a cohort of normal controls, there is a cohort of first degree relatives and there is a cohort of the patients. So they will be classified based on their Prakriti and we will try to fix neurobiological correlates of these concepts as to how they are in patients, what is happening in first degree relatives and how it is different from the normal controls to save or at least to provide evidence for predictability or vulnerability, this will be done. And it also has a component of clinical trials where all the patients of all these diseases will be given treatment and to see if there is any change in those neurobiological correlates with the clinical correlates, Ayurveda correlates. So this is the project that has begun and it is going well. The clinical trial phase is yet to begin. So this, you know, Ayurveda, Yoga and Biomedicine, Integrative Medicine in Neuropsychiatry is what we are looking at. The pharmacological agents, what we are looking at is how this integration is possible. There is no competition in the mechanistics. If you have a biological basis to a particular disease and if your treatment is also having a biological basis, then it is working in those pathways. I still remember, you know, a conversation which I had with Dr. Rajesh Kotechaji, the Secretary of Ayush, who asked me, you know, can you tell, even Dr. Hemant Bhargava, my colleague is here, he will be talking of Yoga next after my presentation, as to how this might be acting. Now what we are seeing is, you give Yoga and give a treatment, the response to the treatment is much better. You give Yoga and the patient is on treatment, the side effects are less. There is some kind of holistic action which is operating through the nervous system is what we are hypothesizing. The same might be happening with the Ayurveda pharmacological agents also is what we said here. Said that looks like a very good hypothesis. Let us say you treat the patient with Brahmi and then let us say give him TMS, the Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation or Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, the response might be much better. You give him something or, you know, they might be acting as modulators, we do not know, and then that is how the holistic action might be happening. So, they are complementing each other, that is why integration is possible, because that is one question which people ask. I have some problem, you give me Rasparidon, you give me Brahmi, you give me Mandukuparana, you give me so many things. Are they not acting to create problems? No, they are acting at different other levels. This is how the possibility of integration in terms of mechanistics is possible. And another thing that we have seen is the utility of Ayurveda. Let us say a patient, you know, I still remember a patient which was referred to us, was treatment resistant schizophrenia and then, you know, was on Clozapine and then we saw that the patient's serum levels were high. But then we did not plan to do anything, but then when we had finished giving him on an androgen, we saw that the serum Clozapine levels had come down significantly, so that we could continue antipsychotic therapies. Then you have treatment emergent complications, menstruations, you know, women resuming menstruations, weight gain being stopped. Then our co-psychiatrist colleagues at the hospital were saying, now we have reference, please do contact IMD, Integrative Medicine Department for constipation, that used to be there, or for treatment emergent complications. So, that is how we are getting the reference. Now, we are in a stage where we might get reference, negative symptom dominant to IMD. We are expecting that to happen. So, these are some of my experiences with, these are, you know, general aspects, experiences with integrative medicine. Rest of the things, I think Dr. Hemant will continue from where I stopped in terms of yoga. Thank you very much. So, now I will introduce Dr. Hemant Bhardwaj, Associate Professor of Integrative Medicine, Department of Neuroscience. Namaste. Namaste everybody. Good afternoon all of you. I am Dr. Hemant. I am an MBBS doctor. During my MBBS, during my internship, you know, I realized that the non-communicable diseases, the way they are growing and the amount of research that is pouring to discover a single molecule to answer all the problems is not bringing any solutions. So, I had to make a U-turn there and I searched all over the country where an MBBS doctor can do an MD in Ayurveda. It was only allowed in BHU, but the competition was very tough. So, I, and it was very difficult for me to understand. In my internship, I got all the Ayurveda books and everything was going above my head and it was very complex for me to understand. So, I thought that let me first begin with yoga and then slowly move towards Ayurveda. It is then that I decided to do MD in Yoga and Rehabilitation from Swami Vivekananda Yoga University, Bangalore. And there I got interest into yoga research and the lifestyle and then I found out that there is actually a lot of potential in our traditional systems which is very much applicable today. And then I did my PhD in Yoga and Mental Health. And over the last decade, you know, this has been the area of my interest. Psychiatry, Ayurveda, Yoga, Transdiagnostic approaches of how we can understand disorders. So, please forgive me, you know, in terms of my Ayurvedic understanding, there are a lot of experts here. I will just share by whatever I understand. So, I offer my greetings from NIMHANS. In 1954, this logo was developed and here Samatvam Yoga Uchhate was already there. So, you know, there has been a vision that for mental health, yoga is inevitable and for Samatvam, you know, this is the verse in Bhagavad Gita where Krishna tells Arjuna, Samatvam Yoga Uchhate. Siddhi or Siddhi, Samatvam Yoga Uchhate. So, that is the approach that we follow. All of you now, you know, clearly understand that these five basic elements which are there all around us, they are there within the body also and the subtler aspect of them are there in the mind also. And Ayurveda and Yoga, all these traditional systems are actually about bringing a balance into them. Both these systems are ancient. They find their origins in Ayurveda. Atharva Veda for Ayurveda and Rig Veda mentions Yoga for the first time. And these five basic elements, you know, if you look at it, the origin of medicine is from Hippocrates. And Hippocrates actually had a humoral theory that was actually based on such fundamental aspects of nature. It was later that the mind and body were split and then that theory was lost. Still in the Hippocratic oath that modern medicine takes, the humoral theory actually plays a role. So, we know now, Vata person has earth and water and typical examples for you to remember, you know, is Atal Bihari Bajpayeeji, you know, he would wait for his next word, what is he going to speak and lot of gravity in his speech. Lata Mangeshkar, you know, these are the people, typical Kapha people. I have learnt all this from my guru, Kishoreji. Pika, you know, we know now what Trump is doing to the world. It is not French. It is strong, but also there is lot of pitta there. So pitta is positively channelized, you know, can be very constructive, but otherwise, you know, it can destroy also. So we have seen the positive construction also we see here. Vata people walk very fast, they eat very less, they are very impulsive and want to achieve things very fast, so very difficult for them to gain weight. This is typical vata thing. But you know, as Shetty sir presented very nicely, it matches with my understanding also, that as you age, you know, there is a small baby, chubby baby is kapha, a young dynamic adult is a pitta, you know, around 40s. And then later on as you age, the earth, water in you slowly, you know, is getting withered away and vata is increasing. That is what we see in dementia also, that slowly the brain, the empty spaces, the ventricles actually is nothing but air, you know, more and more earth and matter of the brain is becoming air. It means the vata is increasing. So fortunately, in traditional texts, there is a vata preventive lifestyle, you know, can I use that lifestyle to prevent this kind of progression of the disease, this is very, very important aspect. Before we go into that, you know, there have been some wonderful evidences that have come up. There is an indirect evidence that showed that people who had at least done yoga regularly for the past 3 years, you know, and as compared to people who had not done yoga, not that they were completely following an erratic lifestyle, they were doing something else, but they were not doing yoga. It was observed that as you age, the grey matter in the brain naturally shrinks, you know, but the shrinking, the slope was much less steep in the yoga arm as compared to the control arm. So this was statistically significant. Similarly, long term yoga practitioners have shown enhanced neuroplasticity and there is, you know, you can see grey matter volume has increased and this Hariprasad et al. is actually an enhanced study. Overall, if you look at the scientific evidence, there are 34 neuroimaging studies and in conclusion it says that yoga increases, regular practice of yoga at least for a year. We were able to demonstrate it within 6 months also. It increases grey matter volume in the brain. So not only that, yoga stops the natural shrinking of the brain, it can increase the volume. Insula is very important area for interceptive awareness. Hippocampus, we know, is the major organ that shrinks in dementia. So yoga increases hippocampal volume also. Similarly, prefrontal cortices show more activation and there is functional connectivity in the DMA for health, which, you know, yoga has been found. This is the study I was talking about. This study was performed as a randomized control study in old age homes where people, you know, yoga therapists went to old age homes in Bangalore, took 5 days a week yoga session for them. A scan was done at the baseline and at the end of the study and we observed that though they were not people with dementia, they were healthy elderly people who showed an increase in the hippocampal volume. This was published in 2013. Similarly, another study showed the, you know, autogenic neuromodulation effect of yoga, where Om chanting was able to bring about a deactivation. 10 times Om. Om and Ma in the ratio 1 is to 2. Om. You chant 10 times, the area of the brain, which is the amygdala, responsible for all negative thinking, you know, anger, aggression, jealousy, that area comes down. And we were also, you know, intrigued by this ancient text known as Mandukya Upanishad which actually described that the A, U and Ma of Om actually have different consciousness attached to it. A is attached to Jagrata, U to Swapna and Ma to Nidra. So, Shakti and Turiya is the transcendental state. So, what we did was, we asked subjects to lie down in a scanner and chant these 3 sounds separately. And we observed that A, actually, this domain of A, U and Ma is how the psychiatric classifies all the psychiatric illnesses in terms of the externalizing, internalizing and psychotic disorders. And yoga is about bringing a balance between the 3 and overall balance of the mind. That is how, you know, Krishna in Bhagavad Gita also talks about bringing a balance in recreation, eating, sleep, then only the yoga can be useful. So, we developed a particular task in FMRI, where subjects chanted A, U and Ma separately and then A, U, Ma together. And we were actually able to find out that A recruited more attentional networks, whereas the Ma was more into the resting brain area. So, therefore, if I am prepared to do certain kind of activity, the A sound comes. Actually, you know, when you want to do something very intense like lifting this table, you produce a sound, Aaaaaa, you know, when you want to think or relax. So, there is something in the sound, in the creation of the consciousness that we were able to find out. And, you know, there are various brain stimulation techniques that are being used. These are all, we can say, the neuromodulation through external means. But the yogis, ancient yogis were doing neuromodulation through the mind, body and breath itself. So, yoga can be a non-invasive brain modulation technique for elderly and this is the comparison of different, you know, TMS, transmagnetic stimulation, direct current and different yogic postures, how they also indirectly affect the brain in the way the external brain stimulation techniques work. So, in fact, the safety of the yoga has been established and it is considered to be very acceptable. This is another randomized control trial where we were able to demonstrate that yoga enhanced executive functions in Raman's matrices. Similarly, the quality of sleep in elderly was much better. We were able to show how yoga works in terms of increase in the BDNF levels, brain derived neurotrophic factor, which is actually responsible for neuroplasticity. It means if the area of the brain is damaged, the other area of the brain can take over the same function and that improves with yoga. And this was being shown in people with depression also where actually BDNF goes down. This is a PhD student at Nihans. Similarly, there are other studies done by other authors who have shown that yoga practice can be useful in early stages of dementia and MCI as well. Similarly, for ladies during the perimenopausal stage, there are 24 randomized control trials. Actually, if you look at the meta-analysis, the confidence interval is quite narrow and there can be a recommendation that yoga can be used routinely for improving the core strength of the elderly. So these are the four asanas which I would like to recommend all the people to enhance their core strength along with very simple practices of alternate nostril breathing and humming or OM chanting for 5 minutes daily. So this is what I would like to recommend. Similarly, there are grounding asanas for reducing mood swings in perimenopausal women. Very good effect in our clinics. You can adopt yoga. Yoga is not something very complex. You can adopt all the poses to suit different ages. For Ataka, there is another study in International Journal of Yoga where in elderly, enhanced cognition, only single practice where you keep candle at 1 meter distance in a dark room and keep looking at it without blinking the eyes till the tear rolls down the eyes. So it generally takes 10 to 15 minutes. Very good practice to enhance cognition and quality of sleep. There are different pranayamas and mudras and of course, we know Sanskrit effect, the mantra effect on the brain. We are doing another study where we are assessing the effect of Vedic mantras on the brain in the people who have been chanting them for a long time and various relaxation techniques. Of course, when you teach yoga to these people, you have to follow certain precautions. Specially, you should be aware of all the co-morbidities and it should be safe. So first objective is in over enthusiasm, you should not harm. We see cases who develop back pain or sprain. So therefore, you have to be very gradual and perform practices under guidance. At the end of it, one question comes, what is the purpose of life? That is what elderly people ask and yoga is not only about practices. There is very rich philosophy also where you can use these four dimensions of yoga to four different kind of personalities. Emotion dominant personality can choose bhakti yoga. Intellectual personality can go to jnana yoga. Will power dominant people, determined people can go to raj yoga. People who are workaholic can follow the karma yoga. So Ramana Maharshi asked who am I? Mahatma Gandhi said every moment is useful and contributed to the selfless service of people. Vivekananda was a meditator and Meera Gandhi devoted everything to God. So this is the lifestyle approach. You know that actually these are all niyamas. So Adhyaya, Ishwar, Pani, Rana covers in all that. So this can be taken. Yoga enhances the well-being by improving mindfulness, calmness, compassion and sense of connectedness. Connectedness and compassion not only towards others but I become compassionate on myself. So my relationship with myself improves. That is how the quality of life improves. All the modules and the researches that we have done in the last two decades at NIMAS have been published in this book which is available in Amazon. And we at NIMAS have also been offering free yoga sessions for the elderly and bringing this connectivity into our yoga sessions. We started during COVID time but still we see a lot of people who log in and join us. You are also welcome.

This is after 14 days and after 7 days we have seen that in the experimental models, in rat models we have seen the amyloid being completely eliminated by Brahmi and Mandukaparni. Brahmi and Mandukaparni are the most studied drugs in such conditions currently. Now we have finished, this article has been accepted. Now this is the 6th case report of patients with negative symptoms who have responded excellently well with Ayurveda and Yoga therapies. This is another research, ambitious research study funded by Ministry of Ayush. Here we have taken, the aim of this study is to provide comprehensive evidence, neurobiological correlates to neuropsychiatric disorders. In terms of 4, we have taken 2, Schizophrenia and Alzheimer's dementia, Schizophrenia and mood disorders in terms of psychiatry, Alzheimer's dementia and multiple sclerosis in terms of neurology. The 4 pillars of investigation that we have undertaken are Genomics, Neuroimaging and Microbiome and Immune. The study goals are to look at mechanistic aspects of how the Ayurveda based therapies or Ayurveda and Yoga based integrative therapies, how they act. It's like, you know, there is a cohort of normal controls, there is a cohort of first degree relatives and there is a cohort of the patients. So they will be classified based on their Prakriti and we will try to fix neurobiological correlates of these concepts as to how they are in patients, what is happening in first degree relatives and how it is different from the normal controls to save or at least to provide evidence for predictability or vulnerability, this will be done. And it also has a component of clinical trials where all the patients of all these diseases will be given treatment and to see if there is any change in those neurobiological correlates with the clinical correlates, Ayurveda correlates. So this is the project that has begun and it is going well. The clinical trial phase is yet to begin. So this, you know, Ayurveda, Yoga and Biomedicine, Integrative Medicine in Neuropsychiatry is what we are looking at. The pharmacological agents, what we are looking at is how this integration is possible. There is no competition in the mechanistics. If you have a biological basis to a particular disease and if your treatment is also having a biological basis, then it is working in those pathways. I still remember, you know, a conversation which I had with Dr. Rajesh Kotechaji, the Secretary of Ayush, who asked me, you know, can you tell, even Dr. Hemant Bhargava, my colleague is here, he will be talking of Yoga next after my presentation, as to how this might be acting. Now what we are seeing is, you give Yoga and give a treatment, the response to the treatment is much better. You give Yoga and the patient is on treatment, the side effects are less. There is some kind of holistic action which is operating through the nervous system is what we are hypothesizing. The same might be happening with the Ayurveda pharmacological agents also is what we said here. Said that looks like a very good hypothesis. Let us say you treat the patient with Brahmi and then let us say give him TMS, the Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation or Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, the response might be much better. You give him something or, you know, they might be acting as modulators, we do not know, and then that is how the holistic action might be happening. So, they are complementing each other, that is why integration is possible, because that is one question which people ask. I have some problem, you give me Rasparidon, you give me Brahmi, you give me Mandukuparana, you give me so many things. Are they not acting to create problems? No, they are acting at different other levels. This is how the possibility of integration in terms of mechanistics is possible. And another thing that we have seen is the utility of Ayurveda. Let us say a patient, you know, I still remember a patient which was referred to us, was treatment resistant schizophrenia and then, you know, was on Clozapine and then we saw that the patient's serum levels were high. But then we did not plan to do anything, but then when we had finished giving him on an androgen, we saw that the serum Clozapine levels had come down significantly, so that we could continue antipsychotic therapies. Then you have treatment emergent complications, menstruations, you know, women resuming menstruations, weight gain being stopped. Then our co-psychiatrist colleagues at the hospital were saying, now we have reference, please do contact IMD, Integrative Medicine Department for constipation, that used to be there, or for treatment emergent complications. So, that is how we are getting the reference. Now, we are in a stage where we might get reference, negative symptom dominant to IMD. We are expecting that to happen. So, these are some of my experiences with, these are, you know, general aspects, experiences with integrative medicine. Rest of the things, I think Dr. Hemant will continue from where I stopped in terms of yoga. Thank you very much. So, now I will introduce Dr. Hemant Bhardwaj, Associate Professor of Integrative Medicine, Department of Neuroscience. Namaste. Namaste everybody. Good afternoon all of you. I am Dr. Hemant. I am an MBBS doctor. During my MBBS, during my internship, you know, I realized that the non-communicable diseases, the way they are growing and the amount of research that is pouring to discover a single molecule to answer all the problems is not bringing any solutions. So, I had to make a U-turn there and I searched all over the country where an MBBS doctor can do an MD in Ayurveda. It was only allowed in BHU, but the competition was very tough. So, I, and it was very difficult for me to understand. In my internship, I got all the Ayurveda books and everything was going above my head and it was very complex for me to understand. So, I thought that let me first begin with yoga and then slowly move towards Ayurveda. It is then that I decided to do MD in Yoga and Rehabilitation from Swami Vivekananda Yoga University, Bangalore. And there I got interest into yoga research and the lifestyle and then I found out that there is actually a lot of potential in our traditional systems which is very much applicable today. And then I did my PhD in Yoga and Mental Health. And over the last decade, you know, this has been the area of my interest. Psychiatry, Ayurveda, Yoga, Transdiagnostic approaches of how we can understand disorders. So, please forgive me, you know, in terms of my Ayurvedic understanding, there are a lot of experts here. I will just share by whatever I understand. So, I offer my greetings from NIMHANS. In 1954, this logo was developed and here Samatvam Yoga Uchhate was already there. So, you know, there has been a vision that for mental health, yoga is inevitable and for Samatvam, you know, this is the verse in Bhagavad Gita where Krishna tells Arjuna, Samatvam Yoga Uchhate. Siddhi or Siddhi, Samatvam Yoga Uchhate. So, that is the approach that we follow. All of you now, you know, clearly understand that these five basic elements which are there all around us, they are there within the body also and the subtler aspect of them are there in the mind also. And Ayurveda and Yoga, all these traditional systems are actually about bringing a balance into them. Both these systems are ancient. They find their origins in Ayurveda. Atharva Veda for Ayurveda and Rig Veda mentions Yoga for the first time. And these five basic elements, you know, if you look at it, the origin of medicine is from Hippocrates. And Hippocrates actually had a humoral theory that was actually based on such fundamental aspects of nature. It was later that the mind and body were split and then that theory was lost. Still in the Hippocratic oath that modern medicine takes, the humoral theory actually plays a role. So, we know now, Vata person has earth and water and typical examples for you to remember, you know, is Atal Bihari Bajpayeeji, you know, he would wait for his next word, what is he going to speak and lot of gravity in his speech. Lata Mangeshkar, you know, these are the people, typical Kapha people. I have learnt all this from my guru, Kishoreji. Pika, you know, we know now what Trump is doing to the world. It is not French."

                "text": "It is strong, but also there is lot of pitta there. So pitta is positively channelized, you know, can be very constructive, but otherwise, you know, it can destroy also. So we have seen the positive construction also we see here. Vata people walk very fast, they eat very less, they are very impulsive and want to achieve things very fast, so very difficult for them to gain weight. This is typical vata thing. But you know, as Shetty sir presented very nicely, it matches with my understanding also, that as you age, you know, there is a small baby, chubby baby is kapha, a young dynamic adult is a pitta, you know, around 40s. And then later on as you age, the earth, water in you slowly, you know, is getting withered away and vata is increasing. That is what we see in dementia also, that slowly the brain, the empty spaces, the ventricles actually is nothing but air, you know, more and more earth and matter of the brain is becoming air. It means the vata is increasing. So fortunately, in traditional texts, there is a vata preventive lifestyle, you know, can I use that lifestyle to prevent this kind of progression of the disease, this is very, very important aspect. Before we go into that, you know, there have been some wonderful evidences that have come up. There is an indirect evidence that showed that people who had at least done yoga regularly for the past 3 years, you know, and as compared to people who had not done yoga, not that they were completely following an erratic lifestyle, they were doing something else, but they were not doing yoga. It was observed that as you age, the grey matter in the brain naturally shrinks, you know, but the shrinking, the slope was much less steep in the yoga arm as compared to the control arm. So this was statistically significant. Similarly, long term yoga practitioners have shown enhanced neuroplasticity and there is, you know, you can see grey matter volume has increased and this Hariprasad et al. is actually an enhanced study. Overall, if you look at the scientific evidence, there are 34 neuroimaging studies and in conclusion it says that yoga increases, regular practice of yoga at least for a year. We were able to demonstrate it within 6 months also. It increases grey matter volume in the brain. So not only that, yoga stops the natural shrinking of the brain, it can increase the volume. Insula is very important area for interceptive awareness. Hippocampus, we know, is the major organ that shrinks in dementia. So yoga increases hippocampal volume also. Similarly, prefrontal cortices show more activation and there is functional connectivity in the DMA for health, which, you know, yoga has been found. This is the study I was talking about. This study was performed as a randomized control study in old age homes where people, you know, yoga therapists went to old age homes in Bangalore, took 5 days a week yoga session for them. A scan was done at the baseline and at the end of the study and we observed that though they were not people with dementia, they were healthy elderly people who showed an increase in the hippocampal volume. This was published in 2013. Similarly, another study showed the, you know, autogenic neuromodulation effect of yoga, where Om chanting was able to bring about a deactivation. 10 times Om. Om and Ma in the ratio 1 is to 2. Om. You chant 10 times, the area of the brain, which is the amygdala, responsible for all negative thinking, you know, anger, aggression, jealousy, that area comes down. And we were also, you know, intrigued by this ancient text known as Mandukya Upanishad which actually described that the A, U and Ma of Om actually have different consciousness attached to it. A is attached to Jagrata, U to Swapna and Ma to Nidra. So, Shakti and Turiya is the transcendental state. So, what we did was, we asked subjects to lie down in a scanner and chant these 3 sounds separately. And we observed that A, actually, this domain of A, U and Ma is how the psychiatric classifies all the psychiatric illnesses in terms of the externalizing, internalizing and psychotic disorders. And yoga is about bringing a balance between the 3 and overall balance of the mind. That is how, you know, Krishna in Bhagavad Gita also talks about bringing a balance in recreation, eating, sleep, then only the yoga can be useful. So, we developed a particular task in FMRI, where subjects chanted A, U and Ma separately and then A, U, Ma together. And we were actually able to find out that A recruited more attentional networks, whereas the Ma was more into the resting brain area. So, therefore, if I am prepared to do certain kind of activity, the A sound comes. Actually, you know, when you want to do something very intense like lifting this table, you produce a sound, Aaaaaa, you know, when you want to think or relax. So, there is something in the sound, in the creation of the consciousness that we were able to find out. And, you know, there are various brain stimulation techniques that are being used. These are all, we can say, the neuromodulation through external means. But the yogis, ancient yogis were doing neuromodulation through the mind, body and breath itself. So, yoga can be a non-invasive brain modulation technique for elderly and this is the comparison of different, you know, TMS, transmagnetic stimulation, direct current and different yogic postures, how they also indirectly affect the brain in the way the external brain stimulation techniques work. So, in fact, the safety of the yoga has been established and it is considered to be very acceptable. This is another randomized control trial where we were able to demonstrate that yoga enhanced executive functions in Raman's matrices. Similarly, the quality of sleep in elderly was much better. We were able to show how yoga works in terms of increase in the BDNF levels, brain derived neurotrophic factor, which is actually responsible for neuroplasticity. It means if the area of the brain is damaged, the other area of the brain can take over the same function and that improves with yoga. And this was being shown in people with depression also where actually BDNF goes down. This is a PhD student at Nihans. Similarly, there are other studies done by other authors who have shown that yoga practice can be useful in early stages of dementia and MCI as well. Similarly, for ladies during the perimenopausal stage, there are 24 randomized control trials. Actually, if you look at the meta-analysis, the confidence interval is quite narrow and there can be a recommendation that yoga can be used routinely for improving the core strength of the elderly. So these are the four asanas which I would like to recommend all the people to enhance their core strength along with very simple practices of alternate nostril breathing and humming or OM chanting for 5 minutes daily. So this is what I would like to recommend. Similarly, there are grounding asanas for reducing mood swings in perimenopausal women. Very good effect in our clinics. You can adopt yoga. Yoga is not something very complex. You can adopt all the poses to suit different ages. For Ataka, there is another study in International Journal of Yoga where in elderly, enhanced cognition, only single practice where you keep candle at 1 meter distance in a dark room and keep looking at it without blinking the eyes till the tear rolls down the eyes. So it generally takes 10 to 15 minutes. Very good practice to enhance cognition and quality of sleep. There are different pranayamas and mudras and of course, we know Sanskrit effect, the mantra effect on the brain. We are doing another study where we are assessing the effect of Vedic mantras on the brain in the people who have been chanting them for a long time and various relaxation techniques. Of course, when you teach yoga to these people, you have to follow certain precautions. Specially, you should be aware of all the co-morbidities and it should be safe. So first objective is in over enthusiasm, you should not harm. We see cases who develop back pain or sprain. So therefore, you have to be very gradual and perform practices under guidance. At the end of it, one question comes, what is the purpose of life? That is what elderly people ask and yoga is not only about practices. There is very rich philosophy also where you can use these four dimensions of yoga to four different kind of personalities. Emotion dominant personality can choose bhakti yoga. Intellectual personality can go to jnana yoga. Will power dominant people, determined people can go to raj yoga. People who are workaholic can follow the karma yoga. So Ramana Maharshi asked who am I? Mahatma Gandhi said every moment is useful and contributed to the selfless service of people. Vivekananda was a meditator and Meera Gandhi devoted everything to God. So this is the lifestyle approach. You know that actually these are all niyamas. So Adhyaya, Ishwar, Pani, Rana covers in all that. So this can be taken. Yoga enhances the well-being by improving mindfulness, calmness, compassion and sense of connectedness. Connectedness and compassion not only towards others but I become compassionate on myself. So my relationship with myself improves. That is how the quality of life improves. All the modules and the researches that we have done in the last two decades at NIMAS have been published in this book which is available in Amazon. And we at NIMAS have also been offering free yoga sessions for the elderly and bringing this connectivity into our yoga sessions. We started during COVID time but still we see a lot of people who log in and join us. You are also welcome. Every day in the morning."

        "full_text": "Aging in Ayurveda, it is the act of wearing out, that is jiriyan pi iti jara, that which has become old by the act of wearing out, ok. So, if you see the common points between biological definition and Ayurveda, it is the degeneration, depletion and deterioration, ok. So, we are, we all agree that aging is a process which involves degeneration. Types and factors that influences aging, there is two types, mainly broadly two types, kalaja jara which is can be correlated with the chronological aging and akalaja jara which can be correlated with the premature aging, that which is influenced by the factors, various factors, it can be correlated with the biological aging of tissues and cells. So, this is influenced by various factors and prime factors amongst them is these three, ahara, apatya ahara, ok, apatya achara and apatya vichara, ok, unhygienic or unhealthy dietary habits, unhealthy lifestyles and unhealthy thoughts. The thoughts, stress, anxiety, jealous, ok what we call as arishadvarga, they promote, they trigger premature aging. So, we should be taking care of these and even prakriti as Bhavna Prasad ma'am told, prakriti also plays that we can correlate to some extent with the genetics that also plays an important role in triggering aging, ok. So, now when we are talking about aging, let us understand the stages of aging mentioned in Ayurveda, ok. So, this is not different from what we know now but what I would like to highlight is the effect of doshas here. There is balya, the childhood which is up to 16 years, it is mainly kapha predominant, madhyama up to 16 to 70 years, it is known as madhyama which is pitta predominant and vruddha of 71 years onwards and in Kali Yuga it is said that we live for 100 years, optimum aging is up to 100 years, from 71 year onwards we call it as vruddha. So, that is vruddha predominant, ok. So, this is as per the chronological aging. So, we see that we should live up to 100 years, right. So, what are, so now we know that stages of health, aging, we should understand when we are talking about healthy aging, we should understand what is health. Already Bhushan sir and Bhavna Prasad ma'am, they mentioned about what is aging. We know that what is the definition of aging health in, from World Health Organization. Ayurveda has given a comprehensive definition. Health is a state of harmonious balance of physiological functions, body tissues, digestion, metabolism and excretion along with the contended state of senses, mind and consciousness, ok. This is from Acharya Sushruta 5000 years back. And the foundational principle of Ayurveda is swastasya swastarakshana. When we talk about longevity, preserving health. So, this is the foundational principle, objective of Ayurveda, preserving the health of the healthy and to treat, to cure the disease, ok. But how do we attain this? Ok, now we know that we should be healthy. So, there are various factors that are mentioned in Ayurveda. I will be dealing with the four main factors, main contributors, that is dinacharya, ritucharya, panchakarma and rasayana, ok. So, this is the clock, Ayurvedic clock, ok. What we understand is, there is a dosha. The dosha will be having its influence as the day proceeds. There will be vata, pitta, kapha influence will be there. Dinacharya is nothing but we are setting, we are connecting with our internal clock, right. So, when vata is predominant, we will be more active. Kapha is ok. So, we should be thinking of more creative work and when we say about breakfast, lunch, dinner, we should be having a good meal, heavy meal during the pitta kala and in the dieted time. Day clock and night clock is mentioned and if I can say that the expression of language was different, but Ayurveda people knew about this circadian rhythm and also the secretion of melatonin. But the language is different. There are various research studies, especially in the chronobiological studies. Rhythm of seasons. India, we are bestowed with six seasons and each season will have its different influence on the nature and also on the body, ok. So, we are prakriti purusha, what we call, no. So, we are influenced by the changes of prakriti and accordingly, we should follow various diet and lifestyle transition as per the season, ok. We cannot be consuming the same sweet taste in all the season, ok. We cannot be doing, you know, similar kind of exercise on all the seasons without understanding the seasons effect on us, without understanding our capacity during the season. And accordingly, there will be accumulation of the doshas, what we call vata, pitta, kapha and there will be aggravation of the doshas, especially in varsha, sharad and vasantarutu and there are mentioning of prophylactic measure of purification during this rutu for healthy living. Prakriti, I will not get into the detail as Bhavana madam has told, but I would like to inform that why we should know prakriti, ok. For those non Ayurveda people, if you are here, so, if we understand our prakriti, it is like, you know, kundali to our health, ok. This is what is good for us. This diet and lifestyle may aggravate our doshas. So, we should avoid or minimize these diet and lifestyle and accordingly, we should take these purificatory measures for a healthy living. So, this is what prakriti, knowing prakriti and following the prakriti guidelines will help us to follow the path of health. Next, coming to panchakarma. Panchakarma are a set of five purificatory, bio purificatory, purifactory therapies and they are designed to eliminate the toxins from the nearest way. For example, if kapha, for kapha and fat related condition, there will be medically induced emesis that is done, it is known as vamana. For pitta conditions, mainly for pitta conditions, medically induced supervised purification that is virechana and for urdhva jatragadha, for above the clavicle conditions, we recommend nasya and even that has its influence on CNS also and basti chikitsa is mainly given for all the vata vyadhis and rakta moksana is related with the pitta and rakta doshita, ok, blood vitiated conditions. Ok. So, one thing I would like to say is the procedure is same. The medicine what is used here will be different for each of these procedures based on the condition, based on the prakriti of person and for which they are coming to the, for they are coming to the doctor. There are various research studies that are established the positive impact of panchakarma not only on the clinical conditions, but also on biological and also cellular and metabolic profile is also established with the panchakarma. Next coming to rasayana. Rasayanam chatagneyam et jara vyadi nasanam. This will be the most interesting topic for today. Our next speaker Dr. Suhas will be talking, he will be discussing more on this rasayana. What I would like to inform here is rasayana is just not the herb. It can be a diet, it can be formulation, it can be even achara rasayana, the way we talk to other person, the way we maintain the code of conduct even and one is at the level of slow thirst, microcirculation and bioavailability clearing the channels.",

For pitta conditions, mainly for pitta conditions, medically induced supervised purification that is virechana and for urdhva jatragadha, for above the clavicle conditions, we recommend nasya and even that has its influence on CNS also and basti chikitsa is mainly given for all the vata vyadhis and rakta moksana is related with the pitta and rakta doshita, ok, blood vitiated conditions. Ok. So, one thing I would like to say is the procedure is same. The medicine what is used here will be different for each of these procedures based on the condition, based on the prakriti of person and for which they are coming to the, for they are coming to the doctor. There are various research studies that are established the positive impact of panchakarma not only on the clinical conditions, but also on biological and also cellular and metabolic profile is also established with the panchakarma. Next coming to rasayana. Rasayanam chatagneyam et jara vyadi nasanam. This will be the most interesting topic for today. Our next speaker Dr. Suhas will be talking, he will be discussing more on this rasayana. What I would like to inform here is rasayana is just not the herb. It can be a diet, it can be formulation, it can be even achara rasayana, the way we talk to other person, the way we maintain the code of conduct even and one is at the level of slow thirst, microcirculation and bioavailability clearing the channels."

Spirituality and longevity, if we begin with epidemiology, the top killers due to NCDs are heart disease, cancer and respiratory disease, the total number of deaths due to COVID-19 over 3 years were about 7 million and I just want you to look at that figure, there are 17 million deaths due to heart disease every year, for COVID the whole world was shut down, neither KFC nor McDonald's was shut down because of heart disease which kills 17 every year, quite a paradox, 1948 we are all familiar with the definitions of the WHO, I will use this concept to look into 4 paradigm shifts, I feel these are fundamental to our understanding about lifestyle medicine, we will go through each one of them, there is a paradigm shift from medical care to healthcare, we will keep hearing it all the time, we are looking after organ based approach to a whole based approach, from symptom based treatment to root cause and treating disease to promote well-being, so if you look at the first paradigm, we are talking about change from the whole world medical which almost all the medical colleges are named to something health, I was very intrigued to find and I worked here for about 6 years, it is called BP Corral instead of health sciences, the word health itself makes your mind think from medical to health and that is one of the first paradigm shift that we need to move, when I came to CMC, well it was interesting to note some of the words used, for pediatrics they use the word child health, psychiatry is mental health and preventive social medicine is community health, that one word speaks it all between us being a little, I wouldn't want to use reductionist, I will use the word specialist from specialist perspective to holistic perspective, the second paradigm shift is from organ based to whole person based, from a super speciality to family medicine, I don't want us to stop going for cardiology but here is what I would use, we should treat the patients with a super specialist positions but in a holistic manner, if you can get that paradigm that means we are not saying that you don't go into details of learning medicine but keep that holistic, Robinson says very good, don't come so close to the tree that you recite of the forest and that is so very important, the American College of Lifestyle Medicine has come with 6 pillars, we know that, it is very interesting to see the American Heart Associations came up with this Life Simple 7 in 2010 which was upgraded to Life Essentials 8 in 2022 incorporating sleep, so now most of the mainline streams have started acknowledging and accepting it and most important is how do you manage an equilibrium between all these domains and imagine this concept has been existing in ancient culture of the Chinese, the Greeks and Ayurveda where you talk about a balance across all these domains, next is a paradigm shift 3 where we talk about symptom to root cause, now it's very interesting, I usually ask the questions, how do you treat malaria, what is a patient with malaria presence with fever, so I said why don't you give them paracetamol, oh but then the fever will come back again, so give them paracetamol after 4 hours, so treatment of malaria is paracetamol 4 hour before lifelong, acceptable, absolutely absurd but what are we doing with all other disease, every other disease we treat them for lifelong, something to think about, paradigm shift 4 is where we move from treatment to remission or reversal, we are talking about cure, can we cure diabetes, of course no, can we treat diabetes, yes, can we ask the question again, can we cure diabetes, very reluctantly we have, we had to take the help of our surgeon colleagues to teach us how to remit diabetes and you know the bariatric surgeries and these other studies which showed diabetes remission and to look at those figures 83%, 72% and so lifestyle medicine also began to look at a trial, the direct trial and the retuned trials which shown diabetes remission on these following percentages, so can we cure diabetes, if you look into the American Diabetic Association vision statement, when they began, they were talking about eradicating diabetes, right, we also started with national malaria eradication program, then we kind of a switch case and made it control program, so finally the American Diabetic Association has accepted in 2020 to use the term diabetes remissions and they have given the classifications for that, somewhere in 1990, Dr. Dean Amish, many of you are familiar with, brought on this very historical concept that process like atherosclerosis can be reversible, his study published in 1990 and 1990, that's it in German, you can look at the weird expressions, so here I'm just going to show you some of the landmark studies, since we are short of time, this is just to give you a sense that lifestyle is not about some people's wishful thinking, but something that is well based on science and these are the compilations of various studies that has been done right from 1928 onwards, just a few of them, I'm just giving you the date, 1948 when the WHO definition was kept, we all heard about Framingham study, for the first time we came to know the risk factors for heart disease and that was listed on and this whole group of people in Boston and Framingham, we first time came to know the risk factors for heart disease, in 1970 the Adventist Health Study, there were two cohorts and here we found the associations of various lifestyle principles, I'm not going to the details, the nutrition, the exercise, the social connectedness, the spirituality showed that people, one lived longer, had fewer diseases and that people were able to connect with each other, Harvard Medical School started their cohort, first with the nurses and then later on with the physicians called Nurses Health Study and the Physician Health Studies, look at those numbers and look at the period of follow-up, all these were talking about the same thing, the associations of most of our non-communicable disease with diet, various aspects of diet, heart disease, decrease trans fats and red reduces your heart, increasing fiber and nuts reduces your heart disease, breast cancer was one of the major studies among the nurses which shows strong correlation of obesity, sedentary lifestyle, alcohol and hormone therapy, look at hormones, the environment also contributes to our health and longevity, numerous studies has been looked into the effect of pollution in the air, water, food. We have association of smoking and alcohol has always been well proven and the new in the field is climate change and screen exposure. Somebody said within the first one to two hours of your day, you are exposed to more than 5,000 chemicals from your brush, to your face wash, your shampoo, to your soaps, everything has a thing. When you look at the social, we have social factors, social relationships, social support and social engagement. Just look at it, loneliness is more dangerous than obesity and that's damaging to health as smoking 15 cigarettes a day and money and fame, in this study, money and fame has nothing to do with happiness. And on stress, our Nobel Laureate, Dr. Elizabeth Blackburn talked about how with increasing stress, there's decrease in the telomere length which reduces your longevity and if you look at spirituality in both the two blue zones, Okinawa, they talk about Maui, which is talking about meeting for a common purpose, one of the major reasons for their longevity are social connectedness and having a purpose in life and the seven-day Adventists at Loma Linda, they drive the purpose and meaning on a peculiar observance on Sabbath, they stop all work, connect with people, look upon for the transcendence. So what is health? Health is a balance between all these domains, disease is a disequilibrium and if you look at the disease model, the largest component is lifestyle and so what is healing? Healing is really getting back that equilibrium and so here is what I want to say, this is not an easy thing, it's complex, you have to address self-issues, you have to address environmental issues, both physical and social, who has a time and finally the transcendence, behavioural change is always complex and look at the lapse rate, when you give them simple educations, hardly at the end of one year, you hardly have people following, you have to bring some meaning in life and the values and morality is what determines the choices that you make and if we are able to do that, we are able to bring health and happiness among people, so thank you for your patience audience.

        "full_text": "And it's also a classic example of inter-species interactions between the microbe and the host. And as you all know now that the microbes that reside inside an animal's body and outside are key resources for health and longevity. And they provide supplemental food power to us. They go for proteins and metabolites that we cannot go for. They are rich sources of energy. They train our immune system. And most importantly, produce micronutrients like vitamin B12 which we cannot produce. And so, it's quite natural that if there is an imbalance in the microbiome or the microbial population which resides inside us or outside, which is commonly called dysbiosis, it leads to many of the characteristics, characteristic aging related diseases. Like here, neurodegenerative diseases, obesity, diabetes and others. So, this is a very complex biology, right? So, you need simplified systems. And in our laboratory, we use a very simple and classical model system to study aging, which is called Synerapt-Edge's elegance. And we typically use it because it's having a short lifespan. It's quite transparent, easy to store. And most importantly, it is backed by powerful genetics. And having 70% conservation with the human genome, it's quite relevant to humans. And more importantly, it is a bacteriophore. So, the bacteria serves both as its food and establishes a microbiota inside. So, you can modify or manipulate both the bacteria and the host and ask for the interspecies interaction. Yes. So, in the laboratory, typically, we feed C. elegans with either of these two bacteria. One is called the OP50. It's a B strain of E. coli or HT105, which is a K12 strain. And these ones seem to be very happy if they eat either of these bacteria. And they have internal homeostatic mechanisms, which prevent random life history changes if you feed one bacteria and the other. And these are maintained by gene-diet interaction, a very important aspect of biology we have started to understand very recently. So, these genes maintain the homeostatic state of these worms. And you would not see any changes unless you have particular mutants, which are either mutations in MAR1, which is a neurobacterial gene, in C. elegans, or in RIC2, which is a Rictor or torsidu ortholog, or in a protein-dehydrogenase gene in the muscle. And typically, in these mutant worms, they show altered life history traits or increased or decreased lifespan on one bacteria and not the other. And over the last several years, we got interested quite, you know, by chance, on a sedentary kinase called SHU4, which shows increased longevity and stress tolerance on particularly the HT105 bacteria, but not on OP50. So, a long time ago, when Sonia Verma, who is now a faculty in CDRI Lucknow, joined my lab as a, you know, graduate student, quite serendipitously, she found that this SHU4 mutants have an exceedingly long life when they were grown on this bacteria, but on the OP50 bacteria, it had a normal lifespan. As I told you, that the wild types do not really care whether you feed this bacteria or the other. Now, through some careful genetic analysis, she showed that in the SHU4 mutant fed on this bacteria, there is activation of the P12K-MAP kinase pathway, which is a conserved innate immune response pathway in C. elegans, and that leads to increased cytoprotective gene expression, several tolerance including osmotic tolerance, and thereby increasing lifespan. And she could visualize this entire process using a simple biomarker, which is one of these cytoprotective gene promoter feeds to GFP, and as you can see, only when the mutant forms are grown on this bacteria, you see the expression of this transgene and not on the OP50 bacteria. So, throughout my talk, I'm going to show you only this globe, and you have to correlate this with increased longevity and stress tolerance. That will make both our lives easier. So, when Tripti Nayak joined my lab, she started understanding why, what is the difference between two bacteria, and she found that this HT105 bacteria has intrinsically higher B12 content compared to OP50, and when the worms are fed B12, the worms do not make B12, they depend on E. coli, which also do not make B12, and E. coli now has non-specific B12 pumps, which pick up B12 from the media and provide it to the worms. When we feed the worms with high B12 diet, the internal concentration of B12 in these worms also increase, and what she showed very nicely is that when she supplemented the low B12 OP50 with increasing concentrations of B12, she got back the gene expression, and of course, the lifespan on the low B12 diet can be rescued by supplementation. So, from now on, I'm just going to show you this data. So, what does B12 do? So, B12 is required by two enzymes in the system. One is methionine synthase, which I'm going to talk about today, and the other one is a mutase, which converts methionine LCOA to succinyl LCOA, that's another story which I'm not going to talk. So, B12 is required by methionine synthase to convert homocysteine into methionine, and actually this enzyme integrates two very important pathways, the methionine cycle and the full-head cycle, and this constitutes the one-carbon metabolism of an organism. So, to summarize the two work that I just presented, what we find is that in the fluorophore mutant, the one-carbon cycle flux is increased, and that leads to an increase in the signaling of the P38 map kinase pathway in the mutant, and that leads to increased cytoprotection, stress tolerance, and longevity. Now, when Shabnam Sen Rehman joined my lab, she asked a simple question, is this metabolic pathway and this signal transduction pathway temporarily separated in the walls? So, how did she address this question? So, as I told you, C. elegans is a genetically aminable system, and you can put in a knockout gene at least. So, what she did is she made a fluorophore and METR1, which are in synthesis double knockout, and put back this metabolic pathway only in the intestine or in the neuron. And what she found, very interestingly, is that only when she rescued the metabolic pathway in the neurons, did she get back the gene expression and longevity, but not in the intestinal sense. And when she rescued this back into the neuron, these worms now started responding to B12. And as you can see, on low B12 diet, it doesn't glow, but when the neuronally rescued worms are fed high B12 diet, they start glowing. So, the next question was, where does P38 map kinase pathway work? And in a related experiment to what I just showed, what she did is knock down the expression of the gene migration in the intestine or in the neurons. And simply by knocking down the gene in the intestine, she could, by knocking down one of these upstream kinases of P38 map kinase, she could reduce the gene expression and the longevity significantly. So, to summarize, what we have is the metabolic pathway downstream of the fluid pore functions in the neuron, and the signal transduction pathway functions in the intestine. So, she asked what could be the mechanism of the neurotransmitter signaling. So, to cut the long story short, she figured out that both neuropeptide and neurotransmitter signaling were involved, and the neurotransmitter turned out to be serotonin. So, if she makes a fluid for TPH1, a double mutant, where TPH1 is the red-limiting step in serotonin biosynthesis, the gene expression goes down, so does longevity, and simply adding serotonin from outside could rescue this. So, next she showed that when the mutant worms are fed high B12 diet, there is a transcriptional upregulation of the TPH1 gene, and that leads to increased serotonin biosynthesis in the serotonergic neurons. So, next she asked where is serotonin working? It could work practically here, here, or here. And one of the experiments she did among many is to knock out the metabolic pathway of serotonin. in the neuron and then supplements serotonin and she found that that could rescue the phenotype placing serotonin downstream of the metalloid pathway. So finally, she you know figured out what are the serotonergic neurons which are involved and by the 6 pairs of serotonergic neurons, she found only rescuing the metallic pathway in the pair of serotonergic neuron was sufficient to you know complete the intact signaling process and bring back longevity as well as gene expression and stress tolerance. So it says that B12 is actually working only in 2 serotonergic neurons in the head region of the worms which we call brain and that can regulate systemic aging by activating B38 in the intestine. So if you have serotonin, you need to find the receptor for serotonin for which she systemically knocked out the serotonin receptors and it turned out to be mod 1 which is unfortunately not expressed in the intestine which would have been which would have made our life quite easy but is expressed only in some of the interneurons and if you knock out mod 1, you suppress the gene expression and longevity and these worms now become recalcitrant to serotonin. Yeah, it becomes recalcitrant to serotonin and serotonin doesn't work. So once we have the mod 1, we as I told you, mod 1 doesn't express in the intestine. So we did not have the connecting loop. So we went back and again to cut a long story short, figured out that this is bridged by a neuropeptide which is a glycoprotein hormone in C. elegans called Flur2 and this Flur2 when you knock Flur2 out in the Flur4 mutant, you take away the gene expression as well as longevity and again it becomes recalcitrant to serotonin. So now the important question is that is Flur2 secreted by the same neuron which receives the serotonin signal? So for that, what Shabnam did is she rescued the expression of Flur2 in the mutant using a mod 1 promoter putting Flur2 back only in the interneuron which expresses mod 1 and as a result, she could get back the expression of transgene, the GFP as well as lifespan. She went ahead to also identify the receptor of Flur2 in the intestine which happens to be a follicle stimulating hormone receptor like protein in C. elegans and as expected, it suppressed the gene expression and longevity and this also is recalcitrant to serotonin. So together, this is the model that I want to end my talk with that in the Flur4 mutant which has a long life on high B12 diet, the methionine cycle and the 1000 metabolism is active only in a pair of serotonergic neurons and leads to increased flux through the pathway which we had measured by metabolomics and this leads to transcriptional activation of TPH1 and an increased serotonin which is received by an interneuron having mod 1 receptor and this mod 1 containing interneuron expresses and secretes this Flur2 neuropeptide which binds to the cognate receptor in the intestine and through a mechanism which I have not shown leads to phase transition of this sound domain containing interleukin like receptor 1 protein on the lysosome related organelles in C elegans and this leads to activation of the downstream P38 myocarditis pathway and this whole pathway is functional only when the serotonin kinase is mutated and these are grown on high B12 diet. So very interesting though, although it controls longevity and stress response, data that I didn't show as I think more interesting to many of the neurobiologists is this exact circuitry controls behavior of the worms. So now these worms prefer high B12 diet if they are given a dietary choice. So we are working currently on identifying the targets of this serotonin kinase and that is turning out to be a very exciting topic. With this I thank you and introduce you to the members of my laboratory and this was mainly carried out by Shabnam Sain Rahman with Shreya Bhattacharya and is now being taken forward by Prerana. Thank you. Thank you very much. So a couple of questions. So what you are asking, so the pathway what you are identifying is an alternative pathway or is a major outcome because your lab works, worms are supplementing by B12. So in a natural scenario, how B12 will act? Is it a negative regulator or a positive regulator? I think negative. So the B12 in a wild type, wild type C elegans, will it act as a positive regulator or a negative regulator for the entire pathway? So it will act as a positive regulator, right, and this gene is preventing the increase in flux in the neurons. Any questions? If you see any decrease in reproductive fitness for this increase of B12? Good question. That we did a long time ago and there is a decrease in reproductive fitness. Particularly the number of eggs, as in all long lived species, mostly, you know, mutants in the lab, there is less reproductive fidelity. Not reproductive fidelity, the number of progeny is less although reproductive fidelity is very high. The quality of progeny is very high, the number is less. How did you identify B12 as a positive regulator? Oh, that took us a while. Yeah, so we looked at many other metabolites. In fact, I didn't say, it's actually B12, it's a methionine which is more important and is sourced from the bacteria, right. So bacteria also uses the same B12 to make methionine and both these micronutrients are now important for development. Thank you. Thank you. The next speaker is Hiroshi Komei. Thank you, every time. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. ",

                "text": "And it's also a classic example of inter-species interactions between the microbe and the host. And as you all know now that the microbes that reside inside an animal's body and outside are key resources for health and longevity. And they provide supplemental food power to us. They go for proteins and metabolites that we cannot go for. They are rich sources of energy. They train our immune system. And most importantly, produce micronutrients like vitamin B12 which we cannot produce. And so, it's quite natural that if there is an imbalance in the microbiome or the microbial population which resides inside us or outside, which is commonly called dysbiosis, it leads to many of the characteristics, characteristic aging related diseases. Like here, neurodegenerative diseases, obesity, diabetes and others. So, this is a very complex biology, right? So, you need simplified systems. And in our laboratory, we use a very simple and classical model system to study aging, which is called Synerapt-Edge's elegance. And we typically use it because it's having a short lifespan. It's quite transparent, easy to store. And most importantly, it is backed by powerful genetics. And having 70% conservation with the human genome, it's quite relevant to humans. And more importantly, it is a bacteriophore. So, the bacteria serves both as its food and establishes a microbiota inside. So, you can modify or manipulate both the bacteria and the host and ask for the interspecies interaction. Yes. So, in the laboratory, typically, we feed C. elegans with either of these two bacteria. One is called the OP50. It's a B strain of E. coli or HT105, which is a K12 strain. And these ones seem to be very happy if they eat either of these bacteria. And they have internal homeostatic mechanisms, which prevent random life history changes if you feed one bacteria and the other. And these are maintained by gene-diet interaction, a very important aspect of biology we have started to understand very recently. So, these genes maintain the homeostatic state of these worms. And you would not see any changes unless you have particular mutants, which are either mutations in MAR1, which is a neurobacterial gene, in C. elegans, or in RIC2, which is a Rictor or torsidu ortholog, or in a protein-dehydrogenase gene in the muscle. And typically, in these mutant worms, they show altered life history traits or increased or decreased lifespan on one bacteria and not the other. And over the last several years, we got interested quite, you know, by chance, on a sedentary kinase called SHU4, which shows increased longevity and stress tolerance on particularly the HT105 bacteria, but not on OP50. So, a long time ago, when Sonia Verma, who is now a faculty in CDRI Lucknow, joined my lab as a, you know, graduate student, quite serendipitously, she found that this SHU4 mutants have an exceedingly long life when they were grown on this bacteria, but on the OP50 bacteria, it had a normal lifespan. As I told you, that the wild types do not really care whether you feed this bacteria or the other. Now, through some careful genetic analysis, she showed that in the SHU4 mutant fed on this bacteria, there is activation of the P12K-MAP kinase pathway, which is a conserved innate immune response pathway in C. elegans, and that leads to increased cytoprotective gene expression, several tolerance including osmotic tolerance, and thereby increasing lifespan. And she could visualize this entire process using a simple biomarker, which is one of these cytoprotective gene promoter feeds to GFP, and as you can see, only when the mutant forms are grown on this bacteria, you see the expression of this transgene and not on the OP50 bacteria. So, throughout my talk, I'm going to show you only this globe, and you have to correlate this with increased longevity and stress tolerance. That will make both our lives easier. So, when Tripti Nayak joined my lab, she started understanding why, what is the difference between two bacteria, and she found that this HT105 bacteria has intrinsically higher B12 content compared to OP50, and when the worms are fed B12, the worms do not make B12, they depend on E. coli, which also do not make B12, and E. coli now has non-specific B12 pumps, which pick up B12 from the media and provide it to the worms. When we feed the worms with high B12 diet, the internal concentration of B12 in these worms also increase, and what she showed very nicely is that when she supplemented the low B12 OP50 with increasing concentrations of B12, she got back the gene expression, and of course, the lifespan on the low B12 diet can be rescued by supplementation. So, from now on, I'm just going to show you this data. So, what does B12 do? So, B12 is required by two enzymes in the system. One is methionine synthase, which I'm going to talk about today, and the other one is a mutase, which converts methionine LCOA to succinyl LCOA, that's another story which I'm not going to talk. So, B12 is required by methionine synthase to convert homocysteine into methionine, and actually this enzyme integrates two very important pathways, the methionine cycle and the full-head cycle, and this constitutes the one-carbon metabolism of an organism. So, to summarize the two work that I just presented, what we find is that in the fluorophore mutant, the one-carbon cycle flux is increased, and that leads to an increase in the signaling of the P38 map kinase pathway in the mutant, and that leads to increased cytoprotection, stress tolerance, and longevity. Now, when Shabnam Sen Rehman joined my lab, she asked a simple question, is this metabolic pathway and this signal transduction pathway temporarily separated in the walls? So, how did she address this question? So, as I told you, C. elegans is a genetically aminable system, and you can put in a knockout gene at least. So, what she did is she made a fluorophore and METR1, which are in synthesis double knockout, and put back this metabolic pathway only in the intestine or in the neuron. And what she found, very interestingly, is that only when she rescued the metabolic pathway in the neurons, did she get back the gene expression and longevity, but not in the intestinal sense. And when she rescued this back into the neuron, these worms now started responding to B12. And as you can see, on low B12 diet, it doesn't glow, but when the neuronally rescued worms are fed high B12 diet, they start glowing. So, the next question was, where does P38 map kinase pathway work? And in a related experiment to what I just showed, what she did is knock down the expression of the gene migration in the intestine or in the neurons. And simply by knocking down the gene in the intestine, she could, by knocking down one of these upstream kinases of P38 map kinase, she could reduce the gene expression and the longevity significantly. So, to summarize, what we have is the metabolic pathway downstream of the fluid pore functions in the neuron, and the signal transduction pathway functions in the intestine. So, she asked what could be the mechanism of the neurotransmitter signaling. So, to cut the long story short, she figured out that both neuropeptide and neurotransmitter signaling were involved, and the neurotransmitter turned out to be serotonin. So, if she makes a fluid for TPH1, a double mutant, where TPH1 is the red-limiting step in serotonin biosynthesis, the gene expression goes down, so does longevity, and simply adding serotonin from outside could rescue this. So, next she showed that when the mutant worms are fed high B12 diet, there is a transcriptional upregulation of the TPH1 gene, and that leads to increased serotonin biosynthesis in the serotonergic neurons. So, next she asked where is serotonin working? It could work practically here, here, or here. And one of the experiments she did among many is to knock out the metabolic pathway of serotonin."

                "text": "in the neuron and then supplements serotonin and she found that that could rescue the phenotype placing serotonin downstream of the metalloid pathway. So finally, she you know figured out what are the serotonergic neurons which are involved and by the 6 pairs of serotonergic neurons, she found only rescuing the metallic pathway in the pair of serotonergic neuron was sufficient to you know complete the intact signaling process and bring back longevity as well as gene expression and stress tolerance. So it says that B12 is actually working only in 2 serotonergic neurons in the head region of the worms which we call brain and that can regulate systemic aging by activating B38 in the intestine. So if you have serotonin, you need to find the receptor for serotonin for which she systemically knocked out the serotonin receptors and it turned out to be mod 1 which is unfortunately not expressed in the intestine which would have been which would have made our life quite easy but is expressed only in some of the interneurons and if you knock out mod 1, you suppress the gene expression and longevity and these worms now become recalcitrant to serotonin. Yeah, it becomes recalcitrant to serotonin and serotonin doesn't work. So once we have the mod 1, we as I told you, mod 1 doesn't express in the intestine. So we did not have the connecting loop. So we went back and again to cut a long story short, figured out that this is bridged by a neuropeptide which is a glycoprotein hormone in C. elegans called Flur2 and this Flur2 when you knock Flur2 out in the Flur4 mutant, you take away the gene expression as well as longevity and again it becomes recalcitrant to serotonin. So now the important question is that is Flur2 secreted by the same neuron which receives the serotonin signal? So for that, what Shabnam did is she rescued the expression of Flur2 in the mutant using a mod 1 promoter putting Flur2 back only in the interneuron which expresses mod 1 and as a result, she could get back the expression of transgene, the GFP as well as lifespan. She went ahead to also identify the receptor of Flur2 in the intestine which happens to be a follicle stimulating hormone receptor like protein in C. elegans and as expected, it suppressed the gene expression and longevity and this also is recalcitrant to serotonin.

        "full_text": "Health at the Indian Institute of Science Medical School. She will moderate the session. If I could also have Dr. Ajita Shaheen, who is the country head for Physicians Association for Nutrition India. And finally, Dr. Sapna from the SCTIMST University Medical School. Thank you. Dr. Sapna, that's fine. So you can come here, Dr. Shaheen, please. You can start. Can I see Dr. Shaheen for a couple of minutes? A couple of minutes, all right. Thank you so much. Then it helps in consolidating your memory process. New synapses are formed. You get the synaptic groaning. New memories are formed and consolidated during sleep stage. There is something called a glymphatic system, which removes all the toxic products, which are activated during maximum during stage three sleep. So there is a lot of biological process which happen during sleep in the brain. And when we learn, like, we all know that there is a change in the pattern of sleep as we age. So beyond 60s and all, you tend to sleep shorter at night. And you tend to have a lot of daytime naps. And also, the sleep quality decreases. You tend to have more fragmented sleep and easy arousals. You must have heard most of our grandparents telling, I hardly sleep at night. And you see that they are sleeping, but still they feel that they are feeling unrefreshed in the daytime. So many of these are a part of physiological process of aging, which we are understanding now. And many of that can be part of disease process also. So where the physiology ends and where the pathology begins, still it is an open question, which researchers are working on. But recent data suggests, especially large population studies, suggest that what we thought happened in 60s and 70s actually start in 40s and 50s. So midlife changes in sleep as well as health are more important, because most of the time, these are the changes that trigger unhealth in the later age. So these are some of the things that we understand more as we learn about sleep. Then when we are sleep deprived, we all know the acute effects. You can't concentrate well in your classes or your work. You tend to sleep off. But it has a lot of implications at the cellular level as well. I don't think to this August audience, I need to explain, because many of you know much more than me about the changes which happen at the cellular level with aging citizens. Many of these are reported with sleep deprivation also. And regarding the interface with the chronic diseases. So we know that many chronic disease, especially diabetes, osteoarthritis, respiratory diseases, stroke, all have an associated sleep dysfunction. So whether the sleep problems started these issues, or whether they have a bidirectional relationship. So you find that many of the chronic sleep problems, like insomnia, sleep disordered breathing and all, they have an increased tendency to develop the vascular diseases, cancers and all. Whereas the patients who have diseases tend to have more sleep problems as well. So that is an ongoing research, and a lot of studies are coming up with interventions in sleep can help in primary and primordial prevention of these diseases as well. Then another thing I just want to touch upon before concluding is what our Indian research shows us about sleep. So we usually previously used to think that these problems are more in the developed countries. It's not so. In large studies, like LASI study, that is Longitudinal Aging Study of India, we have data to suggest that the people above 45 years of age who were followed up, they found that chronic sleep problems are seen in 12% to 15% of the population. And this is true in rural as well as urban population, and men and women. And it was found that in the Chinese studies on longitudinal aging and repair studies, so they found that multi-morbidity, that is one thing that we often learn about, somebody who has three or more morbidities, like diabetes, stroke, or cardiovascular disease, osteoarthritis, so they tend to have a lot of sleep issues. And this affects their quality of life as well as long-term survival. Then, before concluding, just a few solutions. Like this is something that all of us have to think about, and I hope there will be more discussions at the end of this. So what are the possible solutions that we can think of? So one, definitely as in lifestyle medicine, the lifestyle changes, which include changes in sleep also. So better sleep hygiene, which has to be started. Okay, I will finish this. So better sleep hygiene, which we have to start at a school and college level. You can't wait for somebody to grow old, become 60 or 70 to incorporate these habits. So you have to catch them young, make sure that they have a proper sleep, which is continued into early life as well. And other things, the multi-morbidity management. Like in midlife, if you manage these multi-morbidities, future complications due to these asleep problems may be reduced. But these are things that need to be studied further. And other thing, environmental aspects. We all have learned about climate change, noise pollution, all these affecting our sleep quality. So more legislations regarding this is the need of the hour, so that residential areas have more safe zones for people to have healthy sleep also. So I think the rest of that we can hopefully cover in the discussion. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Yes, just thumbs it up, yes. Yes, thank you so much. Give me that. Yes, yes. Thank you. I think you can just slide behind the stand. Oh, yeah. That's it. Good, thank you. That's good. Okay, thank you. Nice to see actually like so many doctors and researchers in this, you know, coming into this field. Yeah, all of us speakers are there in this field for the last 10 years plus. Still we are actually working on what we understood. Dr. Samuel has already shown some of the studies which is basically showing how lifestyle intervention can kind of even reverse disease, not even prevent disease. So I'm just going through a little detail about it. So focusing on whole food, plant-based diet, the larger component of lifestyle medicine. It's one of the components of lifestyle medicine. So this is basically, you know, he has already told about Crammingham study. So what is the outcome of Crammingham study? The first study actually just talked about total fat, right? Later on, we came to know that not the total fat, it's the component of fat which is more dangerous, saturated fat. And you know, if the study is ongoing, there are more data coming in which is not restricted to saturated fat. It's also going beyond, you know, refined carbohydrates and sources of food and stuff. And then we have nurses health study which Dr. Samuel has already discussed, but I think I'll just focus on the dietary part of it. Again, you can see that nurses health study, you know, the next coming healthcare follow-up study, all these studies are done in Harvard and they have huge nutrition research related network there. Here you can see that nurses study also is proving that saturated fat, rich food, red meat, processed meat, I think is bad for human health, not only causing cancer and CVDs, but whereas on the other hand, the diet which is rich in all foods, which is predominantly coming from plants, which is, yeah, whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, vegetables, fruits is really protective against these diseases. Some of the cancers which is extensively studied there are, you know, that breast cancer, it also came because of association with contraceptives, that was the first study. It also studied about colorectal cancer. You can see a lot of data came out. And next one is, these are all epidemiological studies, the initial stage of our study. The nutrition study is basically epidemiological studies, long-term observational studies, multiple cohorts, maybe some of them are cross-sectional food, plant-based eating pattern will be more protective. But, you know, there was a controversy regarding dairy because it showed mixed results. Then you can see that China study came through the picture. How many of you read about China study or watched the documentary or heard about it? Very few. So China's study is basically done by Dr. T. Colin Chandler, one of the greatest researchers I've done, even now, he's 90s, one of the conferences I had an interaction with him. So he came up with an extensive study in China, which actually has experience in a lot of cancer cases, and from 80s to 90s, a book came, which is in 2005, which is about China's study. And the term, whole food plant-based diet was termed by T. Colin Chandler. And his study predominantly focused on China's rural, I think 65 counties, 139 villages, and they found that 350 parameters were taken in, that's health and dietary. And they found that animals were consuming animal products, were highly prone for metabolic diseases and cancer. Many of the cancers, again, colonic cancer, stomach cancer, even non-smoking lung cancer. And casein, till that time, dairy was like, low-fat dairy was okay, kind of a thing, but he came up with a conclusion, his team came up with a conclusion saying that casein from dairy is also really causing cancer, because he has previous animal studies which have done on that, which is showing that if animals fed with casein, there was a 20% increase in tumor growth, with animals which were having tumor already. The one, when they put the animal to one or two weeks of non-casein or 5% casein or dairy, actually the tumor existed. So there was already an animal study proved, which they have actually done in humans, they have analyzed in humans. So casein has shown a strong correlation with cancer. So that is something which was breathtaking research in lifestyle medicine. So that is why we all actually consider him as a major pioneer or stalwart in the field. Then you can see health and healthcare professional follow-up study, the NHS study, the nurses healthcare study was mainly done in women. So they have included men also here. Same findings, predominantly plant-based diet, whole foods, not processed meat and processed food, is actually helping people live longer, healthier, preventing diseases. Then another stalwart in the field, how many of you have heard about Dean Ornish, Dr. Dean Ornish? Yeah, at least some names are there. So Dean Ornish is another stalwart in the field. He has done multiple studies. One of the studies is the earlier study, randomized control trial. He has 48 individuals with heart disease. He has analyzed all those that people who were following healthier plant-based diet were having lesser incidence of secondary events or they have more protective. But he went on to multiple studies. He is one of those ones, he has done his focus to longevity research. So one of the things which, two of the researches which he has done recently, maybe 10 years, 15 years back. One of them is with Elizabeth Blackburn. Dr. Hansdijk has already mentioned about her, you know, the telomere effect. So she has one more minute. So he has done two studies. One is with the prosthetic cancer patient and found out that people who are following a plant-based diet, there is 70% regression in the cancer. And also there is, I think it is, five years follow, they have shown that there is 10% increase in the telomere length. And people who are not following an omnivorous diet were having 3% decrease in the telomere length. So there are multiple studies going on. I am not able to finish up these things, but what I am saying is, following these studies from 2020 onwards if you look, there are tremendous number of studies, huge number of studies which is coming in whole food plant-based diet, not only for reversing and managing diseases, but also for longevity, you know, health plan and stuff. So we can share these slides and we can have a look at it. So there is not much time. You can sit for questions. Thank you. Thank you very much. Am I audible? Yes. Okay. Hi, I am Prati. I work here at ISC. My background, I am a physician epidemiologist working in chronic diseases for the last two decades. So I think very interesting you have set this conversation and I will not ask many questions because I would like audience to interact, but you know, just to set the context. I think in Indian context, and maybe we first start with this week, what do you think, you mentioned that LASI study, by the way, LASI study will be presented on day three. That is one of the opening talks on the day three. I really encourage you all to attend. But you mentioned that there is data on 15 to 20 percent, you said, 12 to 15 percent. So that seems to be quite big. But do you think that we have good quality data to sort of set our research priorities in the area of sleep? That is my first question. I think if so, so do we need more sort of exploratory data to understand the sleep problem or should we be focusing on intervention studies, which can actually sort of help us understand what is it we can do to increase the sleep quality or quantity and the overall impact on health. And I think you may want to sort of mention a little on the age group context because you know the younger people, there is a lot of data that they spend time on devices and hence the sleep is disrupted versus the reason why older people have poor sleep may be different. So the intervention may be quite different as well. That is a very important thought process actually. We, like LASI, I was going to learn that it will be presented in detail. So I also went to a site and got a limited amount of data from that group. So there they have mentioned that they found in the 2016-17 that year, they found that the prevalence of sleep disorders was about 12 to 15 percentage, which is pretty high if you take a population with more than 30,000 participants included in this study. But such robust data is missing from India. We had a group from Mumbai as well as Delhi who did population-based, community-based studies on sleep disorder grieving, but that is slightly older studies, like that was done two decades back. So there they have found the high prevalence of sleep disorder grieving in Delhi as well as in Mumbai because that was the time when the NCDs started rising in India. So that is probably a data which needs to be learned further in the coming decades because we are sure that we have more understanding on diabetes and hypertension now. We know that we are not behind best in prevalence. Maybe we are ahead of the prevalence of diabetes in India. So probably most of these disorders are much more than reported in the literature. So we need good quality data. But I also agree that with the limitation resources and need to move fast because our population is aging faster. And we see a lot of complications of metabolic diseases in the 40s and 50s as compared to Western population where we see, like if you take a prototype stroke, like ischemic stroke, the mean age reported in Western literature is between 60 to 70, like around 67. Whereas in India, consistently all the studies including hospital-based studies as well as population-based studies have shown, registry-based studies have shown that our mean age of ischemic stroke is in the 50s actually, around 55 to 56. So that is a good one decade earlier than the Western reported literature. So good quality intervention studies along with the observational data, now these studies are the need of the hour because we need to catch up with our aging population. Thank you. I think that's very helpful. And one question from you. And we'll take a couple of questions from the audience. I think there's a bit of delay in starting because of the tech problems. So I think we should give time to our speakers. So I think my question to you is, again, Indian context, right? Whenever you talk about plant-based diet, quite often people say, oh, we are a vegetarian nation. Why should we be worried about it? Would you like to throw some light? First of all, what is the difference between plant-based diet versus vegetarianism? Secondly, again, are there any priority research questions that need to be answered? Or we should just be moving to interventions? And do we already know? And so we just go and do it? Or do we have questions to be answered? And if you will be quick. So we'll take a few questions from the audience. Thank you. Yes. OK. Can you please hear me? Sorry. Sorry. OK. So I think the first couple of questions. this plant-based diet, whole food plant-based diet in this context, the whole food plant-based diet is basically something which is rich in, you know, you go towards more of whole food, primarily from plant-based sources, so plant-based sources, then that means that dairy is out of the picture. Okay, but in the Indian context, when you look at it, we are a vegetarian nation, but the way we eat is really, you know, need to be thought about because, you know, we are, we are the diabetic capital of the world, NCDs are going high, so there is something we need to do about it, the vegetarian, the vegetarian food which we consume are not well balanced actually, it is very high in refined carbohydrate, refined oil, dairy and one of those conferences of PAN which we went to Rajasthan and we were, Rajasthan and Gujarat, we were looking at the consumption pattern of these things, some of these things actually, so the dairy consumption in these things, we were just randomly talking to few people and, you know, they are consuming 5 to 6 servings of dairy which increases their saturated fat consumption to 38 grams on an average, which will actually put them into a higher risk of cardiovascular disease and other, you know, may stop. And the other question, so in the, right now we are all looking for Caucasian data, because we don't have much, even observational studies in the Indian context, whatever is done is basically focusing on the vegetarian thing, we definitely need long term observational studies like the cohort study, one of the things which I was proposing any students and researchers here is we have, we have around 200 plus doctors who are following whole food plant based diet, if you can do cross sectional analysis which includes, you know, metabolic parameters, inflammatory parameters and the anti-aging parameters, it would be a great study to start with, we are starting another study with ICMR, in collaboration with ICMR for diabetic intervention using, again an RCT, omnivore diet, you know, WFPB for diabetic reversal or partial remission or complete remission, so we need a lot of studies in the Indian context. Thank you. You can take a couple of questions from audience, I request, keep your question to yourself. Yes, yes, very briefly I will ask, I am Jairam, an organic farmer, much about, told about food, really appreciate, but you see this tremendous change in class, every year is changing, the food is coming mostly from the factory now, and we are talking about vegetable, fruits, all these things, virginal food, but the available food available in the market is totally contaminated and is chemically, all these things are happening. So, what is that, is there any study between the virginal food, what was available about few decades back or even 10-15 years back, every year is changing, now the whole food is coming from the factory food. So, what is my question? That is the one question, how it is, how do you address this question, because vegetables, all those things, people advise us to eat all those things, but it is contaminated by chemicals. Ok. So, that is the one question and I got one question for that, madam, and in the market we get lots of tablets, melatonin, sold, you know, and the advice is no side effects, nothing you can consume, you can have healthy sleep, all those things. Thank you. What do you say about that? Yeah, thank you, sir. Basically, you know, this is some, one question which we always get in all our conferences, actually, we are talking, asking people to eat more vegetables and fruits, one of the major questions, which is like contaminated actually. So, the answer which we give, you know, we do not have a complete answer, but the answer which we give and we are working towards it. One is actually like, there is a study, a NARSA study, sub-study, which was done around 5000 population, which was done with people who were consuming vegetables laden with some pesticides and the people who were completely carnivores were not on vegetables and fruits. The, I think, five years or something study shows that people who are consuming vegetables, even with the basis of these organophosphorus pesticides, having higher levels of health in terms of their blood parameters for multiple of these metabolic markers, even aging parameter, compared to the ones which is not using. I am not saying that you use, you know, pesticide laden vegetables, we need to have more regulations around it, actually. Pran is actually working towards it, we are working with the SSA and other agencies. We take one last question. Actually, you can also interact with them. So, sir, you asked about the melatonin and there are some countries where it is marketed as over the counter, without prescription you can get that. So, but still, like, for improving sleep health, it is one of the medications which is found to be useful to improve sleep and it is a natural hormone in the, which is synthesized in the brain also. But as a physician, you cannot recommend using it indiscriminately because you have to be seen by a doctor whether it is required or not, it has to be assessed before just taking it over the counter. I think your question is very brief. Yeah, that is brief. I came here to learn more about, my name is Diksha, I am representing Project Serotonin. I look at the diet and, like, diet and lifestyle strategies to improve health. So, for sleep, I wanted to ask how nutrition can improve sleep and because tryptophan is a very important amino acid that is regulating the sleep. So, whether protein is important or carbohydrate, because there are studies that even complex carbs is important, especially in the evening, to improve sleep, especially in the evening. So, connection, just highlighted. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. In 2021, Reddy et al. published a paper showing that Indian infants and young children get on average one hour of sleep per night less than their Western counterparts, which is 30 to 45 minutes lower than the lower range suggested. In 2019, Singh et al. did a 13-country study and demonstrated that the average bedtime for young children and infants in India is at 10.30 at night, which is 2 to 3 hours later, which translates into getting less sleep at night than their counterparts. Question. All these children seem to grow up and do remarkably well. Number one, do we need to have Indian-centric recommendations on sleep and or is this part, is getting less sleep in infancy and childhood contributing to my NCDs later in life? Can I just add to that? You can ask questions in the break because we have a few more talks. So, that's a very relevant question. But I think we are yet to have answers because what we see now in the decrease in the sleep in childhood may have its effects maybe 30 or 40 years later. So, at present, it will be difficult to answer. But one thing I can tell you certainly, at least, this is not a scientific fact data. In previous, before the era of television and devices, Indian sleep time also, children's sleep time also used to be much earlier. So, we also, as children, we used to sleep at least at 8.30 or 9. But that has been delayed because after the onset of television as well as devices. So, that question, there is many of the neurotransmitters which are involved in sleep definitely have boosted by some of the dietary factors. But I think this is an evolving area of research where we don't have an exact answer which diet will be the best suited for the best sleep. Can I ask others to ask questions in the break? Basically, lifestyle medicine, we have a course in that. Actually, there are a few studies which has come by which says that one of the things about diet is a high carbohydrate diet. Just before sleep, one hour before sleep, it interrupts the sleep pattern. Okay, there are no more questions and comments. We are going to wind up with this. Thank you very much. It was very interesting. I know you all have lots of questions. Please leave the speakers in the lunch break. Catch them. Don't let them eat. Don't let them sleep. Thank you.",

                "text": "Health at the Indian Institute of Science Medical School. She will moderate the session. If I could also have Dr. Ajita Shaheen, who is the country head for Physicians Association for Nutrition India. And finally, Dr. Sapna from the SCTIMST University Medical School. Thank you. Dr. Sapna, that's fine. So you can come here, Dr. Shaheen, please. You can start. Can I see Dr. Shaheen for a couple of minutes? A couple of minutes, all right. Thank you so much. Then it helps in consolidating your memory process. New synapses are formed. You get the synaptic groaning. New memories are formed and consolidated during sleep stage. There is something called a glymphatic system, which removes all the toxic products, which are activated during maximum during stage three sleep. So there is a lot of biological process which happen during sleep in the brain. And when we learn, like, we all know that there is a change in the pattern of sleep as we age. So beyond 60s and all, you tend to sleep shorter at night. And you tend to have a lot of daytime naps. And also, the sleep quality decreases. You tend to have more fragmented sleep and easy arousals. You must have heard most of our grandparents telling, I hardly sleep at night. And you see that they are sleeping, but still they feel that they are feeling unrefreshed in the daytime. So many of these are a part of physiological process of aging, which we are understanding now. And many of that can be part of disease process also. So where the physiology ends and where the pathology begins, still it is an open question, which researchers are working on. But recent data suggests, especially large population studies, suggest that what we thought happened in 60s and 70s actually start in 40s and 50s. So midlife changes in sleep as well as health are more important, because most of the time, these are the changes that trigger unhealth in the later age. So these are some of the things that we understand more as we learn about sleep. Then when we are sleep deprived, we all know the acute effects. You can't concentrate well in your classes or your work. You tend to sleep off. But it has a lot of implications at the cellular level as well. I don't think to this August audience, I need to explain, because many of you know much more than me about the changes which happen at the cellular level with aging citizens. Many of these are reported with sleep deprivation also. And regarding the interface with the chronic diseases. So we know that many chronic disease, especially diabetes, osteoarthritis, respiratory diseases, stroke, all have an associated sleep dysfunction. So whether the sleep problems started these issues, or whether they have a bidirectional relationship. So you find that many of the chronic sleep problems, like insomnia, sleep disordered breathing and all, they have an increased tendency to develop the vascular diseases, cancers and all. Whereas the patients who have diseases tend to have more sleep problems as well. So that is an ongoing research, and a lot of studies are coming up with interventions in sleep can help in primary and primordial prevention of these diseases as well. Then another thing I just want to touch upon before concluding is what our Indian research shows us about sleep. So we usually previously used to think that these problems are more in the developed countries. It's not so. In large studies, like LASI study, that is Longitudinal Aging Study of India, we have data to suggest that the people above 45 years of age who were followed up, they found that chronic sleep problems are seen in 12% to 15% of the population. And this is true in rural as well as urban population, and men and women. And it was found that in the Chinese studies on longitudinal aging and repair studies, so they found that multi-morbidity, that is one thing that we often learn about, somebody who has three or more morbidities, like diabetes, stroke, or cardiovascular disease, osteoarthritis, so they tend to have a lot of sleep issues. And this affects their quality of life as well as long-term survival. Then, before concluding, just a few solutions. Like this is something that all of us have to think about, and I hope there will be more discussions at the end of this. So what are the possible solutions that we can think of? So one, definitely as in lifestyle medicine, the lifestyle changes, which include changes in sleep also. So better sleep hygiene, which has to be started. Okay, I will finish this. So better sleep hygiene, which we have to start at a school and college level. You can't wait for somebody to grow old, become 60 or 70 to incorporate these habits. So you have to catch them young, make sure that they have a proper sleep, which is continued into early life as well. And other things, the multi-morbidity management. Like in midlife, if you manage these multi-morbidities, future complications due to these asleep problems may be reduced. But these are things that need to be studied further. And other thing, environmental aspects. We all have learned about climate change, noise pollution, all these affecting our sleep quality. So more legislations regarding this is the need of the hour, so that residential areas have more safe zones for people to have healthy sleep also. So I think the rest of that we can hopefully cover in the discussion. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Yes, just thumbs it up, yes. Yes, thank you so much. Give me that. Yes, yes. Thank you. I think you can just slide behind the stand. Oh, yeah. That's it. Good, thank you. That's good. Okay, thank you. Nice to see actually like so many doctors and researchers in this, you know, coming into this field. Yeah, all of us speakers are there in this field for the last 10 years plus. Still we are actually working on what we understood. Dr. Samuel has already shown some of the studies which is basically showing how lifestyle intervention can kind of even reverse disease, not even prevent disease. So I'm just going through a little detail about it. So focusing on whole food, plant-based diet, the larger component of lifestyle medicine. It's one of the components of lifestyle medicine. So this is basically, you know, he has already told about Crammingham study. So what is the outcome of Crammingham study? The first study actually just talked about total fat, right? Later on, we came to know that not the total fat, it's the component of fat which is more dangerous, saturated fat. And you know, if the study is ongoing, there are more data coming in which is not restricted to saturated fat. It's also going beyond, you know, refined carbohydrates and sources of food and stuff. And then we have nurses health study which Dr. Samuel has already discussed, but I think I'll just focus on the dietary part of it. Again, you can see that nurses health study, you know, the next coming healthcare follow-up study, all these studies are done in Harvard and they have huge nutrition research related network there. Here you can see that nurses study also is proving that saturated fat, rich food, red meat, processed meat, I think is bad for human health, not only causing cancer and CVDs, but whereas on the other hand, the diet which is rich in all foods, which is predominantly coming from plants, which is, yeah, whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, vegetables, fruits is really protective against these diseases. Some of the cancers which is extensively studied there are, you know, that breast cancer, it also came because of association with contraceptives, that was the first study. It also studied about colorectal cancer. You can see a lot of data came out. And next one is, these are all epidemiological studies, the initial stage of our study. The nutrition study is basically epidemiological studies, long-term observational studies, multiple cohorts, maybe some of them are cross-sectional food, plant-based eating pattern will be more protective. But, you know, there was a controversy regarding dairy because it showed mixed results. Then you can see that China study came through the picture. How many of you read about China study or watched the documentary or heard about it? Very few."

                "text": "So China's study is basically done by Dr. T. Colin Chandler, one of the greatest researchers I've done, even now, he's 90s, one of the conferences I had an interaction with him. So he came up with an extensive study in China, which actually has experience in a lot of cancer cases, and from 80s to 90s, a book came, which is in 2005, which is about China's study. And the term, whole food plant-based diet was termed by T. Colin Chandler. And his study predominantly focused on China's rural, I think 65 counties, 139 villages, and they found that 350 parameters were taken in, that's health and dietary. And they found that animals were consuming animal products, were highly prone for metabolic diseases and cancer. Many of the cancers, again, colonic cancer, stomach cancer, even non-smoking lung cancer. And casein, till that time, dairy was like, low-fat dairy was okay, kind of a thing, but he came up with a conclusion, his team came up with a conclusion saying that casein from dairy is also really causing cancer, because he has previous animal studies which have done on that, which is showing that if animals fed with casein, there was a 20% increase in tumor growth, with animals which were having tumor already. The one, when they put the animal to one or two weeks of non-casein or 5% casein or dairy, actually the tumor existed. So there was already an animal study proved, which they have actually done in humans, they have analyzed in humans. So casein has shown a strong correlation with cancer. So that is something which was breathtaking research in lifestyle medicine. So that is why we all actually consider him as a major pioneer or stalwart in the field. Then you can see health and healthcare professional follow-up study, the NHS study, the nurses healthcare study was mainly done in women. So they have included men also here. Same findings, predominantly plant-based diet, whole foods, not processed meat and processed food, is actually helping people live longer, healthier, preventing diseases. Then another stalwart in the field, how many of you have heard about Dean Ornish, Dr. Dean Ornish? Yeah, at least some names are there. So Dean Ornish is another stalwart in the field. He has done multiple studies. One of the studies is the earlier study, randomized control trial. He has 48 individuals with heart disease. He has analyzed all those that people who were following healthier plant-based diet were having lesser incidence of secondary events or they have more protective. But he went on to multiple studies. He is one of those ones, he has done his focus to longevity research. So one of the things which, two of the researches which he has done recently, maybe 10 years, 15 years back. One of them is with Elizabeth Blackburn. Dr. Hansdijk has already mentioned about her, you know, the telomere effect. So she has one more minute. So he has done two studies. One is with the prosthetic cancer patient and found out that people who are following a plant-based diet, there is 70% regression in the cancer. And also there is, I think it is, five years follow, they have shown that there is 10% increase in the telomere length. And people who are not following an omnivorous diet were having 3% decrease in the telomere length. So there are multiple studies going on. I am not able to finish up these things, but what I am saying is, following these studies from 2020 onwards if you look, there are tremendous number of studies, huge number of studies which is coming in whole food plant-based diet, not only for reversing and managing diseases, but also for longevity, you know, health plan and stuff. So we can share these slides and we can have a look at it. So there is not much time. You can sit for questions. Thank you. Thank you very much. Am I audible? Yes. Okay. Hi, I am Prati. I work here at ISC. My background, I am a physician epidemiologist working in chronic diseases for the last two decades. So I think very interesting you have set this conversation and I will not ask many questions because I would like audience to interact, but you know, just to set the context. I think in Indian context, and maybe we first start with this week, what do you think, you mentioned that LASI study, by the way, LASI study will be presented on day three. That is one of the opening talks on the day three. I really encourage you all to attend. But you mentioned that there is data on 15 to 20 percent, you said, 12 to 15 percent. So that seems to be quite big. But do you think that we have good quality data to sort of set our research priorities in the area of sleep? That is my first question. I think if so, so do we need more sort of exploratory data to understand the sleep problem or should we be focusing on intervention studies, which can actually sort of help us understand what is it we can do to increase the sleep quality or quantity and the overall impact on health. And I think you may want to sort of mention a little on the age group context because you know the younger people, there is a lot of data that they spend time on devices and hence the sleep is disrupted versus the reason why older people have poor sleep may be different. So the intervention may be quite different as well. That is a very important thought process actually. We, like LASI, I was going to learn that it will be presented in detail. So I also went to a site and got a limited amount of data from that group. So there they have mentioned that they found in the 2016-17 that year, they found that the prevalence of sleep disorders was about 12 to 15 percentage, which is pretty high if you take a population with more than 30,000 participants included in this study. But such robust data is missing from India. We had a group from Mumbai as well as Delhi who did population-based, community-based studies on sleep disorder grieving, but that is slightly older studies, like that was done two decades back. So there they have found the high prevalence of sleep disorder grieving in Delhi as well as in Mumbai because that was the time when the NCDs started rising in India. So that is probably a data which needs to be learned further in the coming decades because we are sure that we have more understanding on diabetes and hypertension now. We know that we are not behind best in prevalence. Maybe we are ahead of the prevalence of diabetes in India. So probably most of these disorders are much more than reported in the literature. So we need good quality data. But I also agree that with the limitation resources and need to move fast because our population is aging faster. And we see a lot of complications of metabolic diseases in the 40s and 50s as compared to Western population where we see, like if you take a prototype stroke, like ischemic stroke, the mean age reported in Western literature is between 60 to 70, like around 67. Whereas in India, consistently all the studies including hospital-based studies as well as population-based studies have shown, registry-based studies have shown that our mean age of ischemic stroke is in the 50s actually, around 55 to 56. So that is a good one decade earlier than the Western reported literature. So good quality intervention studies along with the observational data, now these studies are the need of the hour because we need to catch up with our aging population. Thank you. I think that's very helpful. And one question from you. And we'll take a couple of questions from the audience. I think there's a bit of delay in starting because of the tech problems. So I think we should give time to our speakers. So I think my question to you is, again, Indian context, right?

So we'll take a few questions from the audience. Thank you. Yes. OK. Can you please hear me? Sorry. Sorry. OK. So I think the first couple of questions."

It was very interesting. I know you all have lots of questions. Please leave the speakers in the lunch break. Catch them. Don't let them eat. Don't let them sleep. Thank you."

        "summary": "Key Learnings and Insights:\n• Sleep plays a critical role in memory consolidation, synaptic growth, and the removal of toxic brain products through the glymphatic system, especially during stage three sleep. This underscores the importance of sleep for brain health.\n• The age-related decline in sleep quality, including shorter sleep duration and increased fragmentation, commonly observed in older adults, begins earlier in life, around the 40s and 50s, suggesting the need for early intervention to mitigate long-term health risks.\n• Chronic sleep problems are associated with a higher risk of developing chronic diseases such as diabetes, stroke, and cancer, indicating a bidirectional relationship between sleep disorders and chronic health conditions.\n• Research data, including the Longitudinal Aging Study of India (LASI), highlight the prevalence of chronic sleep problems across different demographics in India, challenging the perception that sleep issues are more prevalent in developed countries.\n• The Whole Food Plant-Based (WFPB) diet, distinguished from general vegetarianism by its emphasis on unprocessed, plant-derived foods and exclusion of animal products and refined foods, has been shown to have significant health benefits, including the prevention and management of chronic diseases and potentially extending longevity.\n\nMain Discussion Points:\n• The physiological and pathological aspects of sleep, especially in the context of aging and chronic disease, reveal a complex interplay that impacts overall health. This highlights the need for further research to distinguish between normal aging processes and disease pathology.\n• The WFPB diet's role in disease prevention and management, supported by studies like the Framingham study, Nurses' Health Study, and the China Study, emphasizes its potential in addressing non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and improving long-term health outcomes.\n• The discussion on sleep emphasized the need for high-quality data on sleep disorders in India to inform research priorities, including whether the focus should be on exploratory studies or direct interventions to improve sleep quality.\n\nAction Items and Applications:\n• Implement lifestyle changes, including improved sleep hygiene practices, beginning in youth to foster long-term health benefits. This proactive approach in schools and colleges can help mitigate the onset of sleep-related and chronic health issues later in life.\n• Address environmental factors contributing to poor sleep quality, such as noise pollution and climate change, through targeted legislation and community planning to create safer, quieter residential areas conducive to healthy sleep.\n• Conduct further research on the impact of diet on sleep quality, particularly the effects of different nutrients and dietary patterns, to develop evidence-based dietary recommendations for improving sleep.\n• Engage in longitudinal and intervention studies on the WFPB diet within the Indian context to fill existing research gaps and validate its health benefits among Indian populations, taking into account cultural dietary practices and the current shift towards more processed foods.\n\nRemember to:\n- Engage with local communities and healthcare professionals to promote awareness and education on the importance of sleep and diet for overall health.\n- Advocate for policy changes and community planning that prioritize environmental and lifestyle factors affecting health.\n- Leverage existing studies and data to inform new research directions and public health interventions aimed at improving sleep and dietary habits in India."

So elderly people eventually have Lyme disease. In a clinical experience, they display a gradual decline of their daily activity. This is due to the impaired disease disruptive capacity. So young people can recover quickly after the stress. But in aged or pregnant people who are disabled, they are resilient. So they cannot come back to the basic level. So resilience is frequently initially described in social science or psychological neurology. So people always pick up this word. Nowadays, we notice that resilience is also the key to understand aging. So they go, for example, in this way. And the key factor which can impair resilience is, now we notice, this kind of sensory cells activating in our body. Because this may be quite a secretory phenotype called SARS. Impairing the neighboring tissue is a recurrent function. So this is a summary of the Xenotherapy which I now propose. So there are two parts. One is Xenostatics, mainly suppressing the SARS phenotype. And the other is Xenolysis, the combination of the sensory cells. Today, I want to talk about both approaches in our laboratory. So you know that now the historical aging theory, calorie restriction could be explained by this Xenostatics function. So there are several key players identified in the calorie restriction history. So I'll try this. And the outcome is also now verified. So activation, is that the reduction of the oxidative stress? Or is it stimulation can boost the mitochondrial genesis? And these key players are also activated by several metabolites. So we started the human metabolism work about 15 years ago. You know, there are thousands of metabolites in the cellular body. And by using the LC-MS, we can comprehensively analyze this profile of metabolites. So in collaboration with Professor Yanagida, we tried to develop our unique approach to identify the human metabolites. We call it the whole blood metabolite. Because 1,000 metabolites are quite large, so we try to make them stable. So finally, we noticed whole blood cleansing is the most straightforward to make the metabolites stable. And using this technology, we tried to investigate several aging-relevant cases. So first, we assigned about 130 metabolites. And this is a summary of the CV value. So here, the upper panel is showing the quite low CV value. That means they are very stable. And the lower one is showing the quite higher CV values. That means they are quite variable. So if you look at these metabolites with high CV values,",
